______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**0.2.0 alpha (Android)**
- Water, lava, fire, or snow could be replaced with Sugarcane, Cactus, and Ladders to create Cactus on grass, Sugarcane on Stone without water, or Floating Invisible Ladders. Due to the replacement of the block bypassing the initial update check, the blocks can be placed.

- Tilling Dirt underwater will give you Underwater Farmland

**0.6.0 alpha (Android)**
- Placing a slab adjacent to the world border and attempting to place a block that needs support (e.g. torches, levers, ladders) on the side of the slab will place them on the world border. When updating the world to infinite this will give you floating torches, levers, or ladders

**0.8.0 alpha (Android)**
- Cacti can grow adjacent to blocks
- Placing Torches on the side of a block and placing a painting on the same block will overlap the painting and the torches

<br>
- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy. These chunks have a random block pallet and can create a lot of illegal formations, like nether wart on top of brewing stand, or illegal blocks such as Education Edition Blocks, and Creative placed Blocks
- Compound Creators can be waterlogged

**1.4.0**
- Putting a TNT on a string that is connected to tripwire hooks and blowing it up, it can create a tripwire hook ghost block. If you mine the ghost block at the same time a portal lights you have an oppurtunity to obtain a portal tile. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYYz6a0VyDQ

**1.5.0**
- Flowers, Saplings, and Dead Bushes can be waterlogged. Make sure to make the sapling a dark oak sapling so it doesn't update

**1.9.0**
- You can put Glass Bottles in a Brewing Stand via hopper

**1.11.0**
- In 1.11, you can place 16 buckets in a furnace fuel slot instead of just one

**1.14.0**

**Beta 1.16.0.57**
- Treasure Bastions spawn with one Barrier Block in one of the lava pools

**1.16.1.2**
- You can exploit commands in this version by removing the space between the /give and the @ symbol. This will not turn off achievements allowing for commands in a vanilla world. This can give you infinite amount of illegals including bedrock, spawn eggs, top slabs, command blocks, and weird blocks in the furnace fuel slot. List of Illegals are in the "1.16.1.2 Guide" file in the "Links Folder". Using this glitch may be considered cheating but it relies on personal preference, some commands will be for sure considered cheating. 
- Giving yourself an item that has a durability bar and adding the metadata of 9999 will give you negative durability items. So using the /give@s netherite_sword 1 9999 will give you a negative durability netherite sword. Combining 4 of these negative durability items in a crafting recipe will give you an unbreakable item with almost infinite durability.
- Using the /execute command you can obtain a lot of other commands by using /execute@s ~ ~ ~ and then your command. Using this method with the /replaceitem command can give you many different items in the furnace output slot and many different items in mobs offhand.

**1.16.40**
- Pistons can extend below y-level 0
- Support Blocks can be placed on Chains
- Endermen can pick up warped and crimson fungus and place it down on any other block

- End Portals do not trigger Block updates. So by flower-logging the end portal frames and activating them below gravity blocks and then breaking the grass block underneath the end portals, the end portal frames will break leaving floating gravity blocks.

**Beta 1.16.230.54 - Beta 1.16.230.50 (Downgrading)**
- Obtaining Dripstone in 1.16.230.54 in small caves and downgrading to 1.16.230.50 will give you dripstone in 1.16.230.50. Placing the Dripstone as tall as you want and pushing the bottom of the dripstone with a piston will not update the dripstone causing for really odd looking dripstone base

**Beta 1.16.230.54 - Beta 1.16.210.61 (0.12.1 Downgrading)**
- Downgrading Dripstone found in small caves from 1.16.230.54 to 1.16.210.61 will cause the dripstone to stay in that version. You can then take the dripstone and place it next to cactus which creates an illegal formation with cactus

**Beta 1.17.0.58 - Beta 1.16.210.54 (Experimental)**

- Various Support blocks (e.g. torches, buttons, levers) can be places on Lightning Rod
- Big Dripleaf can be placed on any block
- Glow lichen can be placed on farmland and dirt path
- Hanging Roots can be waterlogged
- Tying an axolotl to a fence/wall and scooping the axolotl up with a water bucket will not remove the leash knot on the fence/wall and the axolotls will remain unattached and unleashable
- Using Dispensers to remove the water from bubble columns does not destroy the bubble column itself.

**1.17.10**
- Waterlogging stairs or slabs and subsequently breaking them won't update the water, making it possible to create floating water
- Support blocks can be placed on Candles
- Placing an end crystal and placing two piston each on different sides and facing the end crystal and activating them at the same time will cause them both to extend, leaving two piston heads in one block

- Scaffolding at y=1 will not update and fall if there is no block below it
- (Requires Vanilla Experiments) You can place support blocks on the Skulk Shriekers and Skulk Sensors

**Beta 1.18.10.24 (Experimental)**

- Reinforced Deepslate can be pushed by Pistons

**1.18.30**
- All types of Torches, redstone dust, Glow Lichen and Walls can be placed or attached to Bells
- Placing blocks in the lowest subchunk of a dimension and then reloading the dimension to save it and mining up all the blocks placed in the subchunk and reloading the dimension will regenerate the blocks mined up. The side of the main end island does matter on what you'll get in the regeneration, on one side all it will do is regenerate the block without changing the data of the block at all (this is called VCR (Valid Chunk Regen)). On the other side of the main end island will regenerate the blocks but either make them invisible or unfunctionable (this is called ICR (Invalid Chunk Regen)). To tell which chunk is which type type of Regen (VCR or ICR) StormofLight and VirsRJ made a chart of chunks showing which chunks are ICR or VCR, it will be titled "ChunkRegenerationGraph.webp" in "Links". This glitch can be used to create unique blocks like half-beds, invisible shulker boxes, and headless pistons using ICR. This also allows for the creation of different types of wall skulls based on the placement and orientation of the skulls. Placing a skull on the ground gives a Wither Skeleton Wall Skull, while placing them against a wall in certain cardinal directions results in various skulls: West yields a Creeper Wall Skull, South a Steve Wall Skull, North a Zombie Wall Skull, and East a Dragon Wall Skull using ICR. You can also get tons of illegals from ICR by placing tile entities listed in this Minecraft Wiki page https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_entity. You can also get tons of VCR listed in the "Valid Chunk Regeneration Illegals.txt" in the "Links" folder. Tutorial: https://youtu.be/IPCpwxhccsg?si=HzK8bc5HLcrKgLDP
