______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**0.4.0 alpha (Android)**
- The Top Half of the Door can replace the block above where the door was placed. 

**0.5.0 alpha (Android)**
- Activating Nether Reactor Cores at the Bottom of the World can break the Bedrock

**0.8.1 alpha (Android)**
- Using Bone meal on Sugarcane that is not fully grown can break the blocks it

**0.9.0 build 4 alpha (Android)**
- Applying bone meal to grass or a fern in a one-block-high gap replaces the block above with the top half of double tallgrass or a large fern respectively

**0.17.0.2 alpha (Android)**
- Placing a snow layer against a non-full block is able to delete adjacent full blocks that have a valid support block under them

**Beta 1.8.0.8**
- Bonemealing Bamboo can break the blocks above with the new bamboo

**1.16.1.2**
- You can exploit commands in this version by removing the space between the /give and the @ symbol. This will not turn off achievements allowing for commands in a vanilla world. This can give you infinite amount of illegals including bedrock, spawn eggs, top slabs, command blocks, and weird blocks in the furnace fuel slot. List of Illegals are in the "1.16.1.2 Guide" file in the "Links Folder". Using this glitch may be considered cheating but it relies on personal preference, some commands will be for sure considered cheating. 
- Giving yourself an item that has a durability bar and adding the metadata of 9999 will give you negative durability items. So using the /give@s netherite_sword 1 9999 will give you a negative durability netherite sword. Combining 4 of these negative durability items in a crafting recipe will give you an unbreakable item with almost infinite durability.
- Using the /execute command you can obtain a lot of other commands by using /execute@s ~ ~ ~ and then your command. Using this method with the /replaceitem command can give you many different items in the furnace output slot and many different items in mobs offhand.

**1.16.100**
- Placing a sign against a block would replace that block with the sign, making it possible to delete blocks. For example, having a slab on the lower half and placing a sign on it will delete the block directly above the slab. This can also be used to make signs that are supported solely by other signs

**1.17.10**
- Using a powder snow bucket on a cauldron filled with powder snow creates a powder snow block directly above the cauldron. This deletes any block that was previously occupying the space above it including bedrock.

**1.20.50**
- growing a dark oak tree can break blocks south and east of the tree by replacing blocks with its branches. This is normally only able to break blocks in the upwards direction. However, by placing dirt blocks directly above the dark oak saplings to prevent upwards growth, it is possible to make the dark oak tree grow in the downwards direction. This breaks blocks downwards instead of upwards, allows this method to additionally break blocks north and west of the tree, and makes the void accessible. Sadly in Beta 1.18.0.20, attempting to make a dark oak tree grow downwards causes its branches to always generate at Y=-1 through Y=-4, making it impossible to use this method to access the void.

**1.21.51**
- Large jungle trees can also replace blocks in the south and east directions with their branches.
- A nether portal has been able to remove four blocks at its base when it generates. All valid locations for a nether portal to appear in the opposite dimension besides the location of the four indestructible blocks must be blocked to force the portal's generation to replace them.
- When a huge red mushroom is grown, some non-full blocks that collide with the mushroom's growth, such as end portal frames, end portals, and end gateways, are deleted and replaced with mushroom blocks.
