**Classic 0.0.23a_01**
- By placing gravity blocks (sand or gravel) above a water source, the gravity block and the water will swap places, allowing for non-updated water sources.

- <details> <summary>Exploding A Chest while keeping it open will cause the items inside the chest to convert to 0 stack items. These items are useful for duplication, overstacked items, and understacked items. A 0 Stack item is a the most well known duplication method and java illegal, once you have it you can right click in your inventory and it will give you and infinite amount of diamonds. Every time you right click the 0 stack item, the item count will start going into the negatives allowing for negative durability stacked items, and once it reaches -129 it will overlap and the item count will become +127.

- As chests were a full cube from Indev 0.31 20100124-2119 through Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5, many blocks requiring support could be placed against them. The action of "shift clicking" was not implemented in these versions, so to place the blocks onto the chest, they must be placed on a block next to them that cannot support them allowing for support blocks on chests

**Indev 20100128-2**
- Indev Chests would spawn with 100 count items allowing for overstacked items

**Indev 20100201-2**
- Sponges would soak up infinite lava and infinite water allowing for discontinued configurations of the water and lava

**Indev 20100206-2**
- Golden Hoes have a higher durability which is later lowered allowing for negative durability hoes if you lower the durability of the hoe in this current version
- Tilling Dirt underneath a block and then placing seeds on the farmland will remove the block above making it possible for bedrock removal

**Indev 20100219**
-  Any item can be placed in the furnace fuel and output slot

**Infdev 20100316**
> [!Caution]
> This version requires the Infdev 20100316 saving mod to save and quit the game you can find it in the Links folder
> Opening Chests in this version would crash the game
- The Farlands would generate except they are extremely far out, they are a flat wall and they are unreachable by normal means
- The Player would spawn with 999 stacks of axes, shovels, pickaxes, torches, flint and steel, oak planks, glass blocks, and arrows every time you load the world. These are technically -25 stacks which is obtainable, but because of the Chest crash they can not be moved to chests in this version. 
- Brick Pyramids would spawn throughout the world, making it the only method of obtaining bricks, download the file in the "Mods & Extra Files" folder to help you find brick pyramids

**Infdev 20100607**
- Top Half Doors can be created by placing two signs and placing a door on top
- Placing a Door one block below the height limit will result in the Bottom Half Door
- If a sign is destroyed from neighbor updates produced from its placement, it will crash the game. This crash will avoid the check to remove the sign item when the placement code is processed, so a sign zero stack will be left in the player's inventory upon reloading. This is easily accomplished by placing two non-opaque blocks (e.g. glass, slabs) next to each other and placing a sign on top of each. Placing the second sign will cause the first to be destroyed, which will update the second sign and destroy it, causing the crash.
- Placing ladders off of the side of non-opaque blocks with a supporting block next to it can cause the ladder to be rendered invisible. If placed onto a slab that has two full blocks next to it, the ladder could be placed floating above the slab while invisible. The placement of the ladder depends on the direction of the last ladder the player placed, if no other ladders have been placed then using the slab method results in a full block ladder that is rendered invisible.
- By using 15 very long symbols in the same line before the new sign limit system, you can get a sign that would be impossible with the normal character size limits. The longest characters that can be put on a sign include "~", "_", and "m."

**Infdev 20100611**
- Monoliths would generate in flat terrain and they would spawn without bedrock underneath allowing for illegal terrain generation. You can use the Monolith Finder in the "Links" folder

**Infdev 20100615**
- Water and Lava can flow next to each other without forming stone
- Lava will flow 8 blocks in the overworld which will later update to 3 blocks making it an illegal block formations
- Water and Lava do not update correctly, allowing for water and lava in different flow states without a source block
- Caves do not generate in this version allowing for an area with no caves
- In this version no Bedrock will spawn at the bottom of the world. These chunks can be loaded by left unpopulated, if these chunks are then repopulated in later versions then not only will no bedrock generate but the world will generate new stone types and biomes.

**Infdev 20100616-1**
- Holes in the Bedrock can generate when lava pools generate at the bottom of the world

**Infdev 20100617-2**
- The bottom most layer of the world is made of stone and bedrock allowing for holes within the bedrock

**Infdev 20100625-2**
- Added Spawners which can be mined up by hand and will drop as an item, also Infinite Water Source items would convert to a Spawner as well
- Spawners currently have the same block id as signs. If a sign is loaded near a spawner, the spawner will receive sign metadata. Reloading a sign-spawner will crash and potentially soft lock the world in this version. This is fixed in the next version, but the spawner maintains the sign data.
- Placing Doors one block under a block will cause the upper half to break the block up above it making it possible for bedrock removal
- Torches could be placed on leaves if the graphics setting was on 'Fast' (leaves are solid).
- Placing an inclined rail, and then breaking the support block, the game wouldn't update the inclined rail to a flat rail giving you an inclined rail without connections

**Alpha 1.0.1_01 - Infdev 20100630-2**
- Downgrading Redstone that is placed on against a block will convert it to a gear in Infdev 20100630-2. Breaking the block below the gear and updating back to Alpha 1.0.1_01 will create floating redstone

**Alpha 1.0.1_01**
- Activating a lever and then breaking it's support block will keep the lever floating

**Alpha 1.0.4**
> [!Note]
> In order to access the winter mode type and obtain snow and ice, the level.dat will have to be regenerated. This will reset the player position and remove all items within the inventory, as well as changing the world seed. This can be done by deleting level.dat and level.dat_old, then going to the "singleplayer" screen, and selecting the world slot that has the same name as the world save folder. This will likely have to be done several times before the winter type is set to 1
- Snow Layers were added but can only be obtained in the Winter Type Map. Snow Layers would generate on top of all blocks during snowfall which allows for illegal block formations like snow layers on non-full blocks (e.g. stairs and slabs)

**Alpha 1.0.5-2**
- Added Block Replacement Bypass, this is involves placing a support blocks directly into water, lava, fire, or snow. This allows for many illegal block formations such as floating flowers, floating ladders, quintuple chests
- Snowballs in this version would stack to 64 allowing for overstacked snowballs

**Alpha 1.0.6**
- Cactus can be placed on and next to any block allowing for many illegal block formations

**Alpha 1.0.11**
- Placing a door next to a cactus would create a half door
- Buckets of Milk can be stackable to 64

**Alpha 1.1.1**
- Fishing Rods would stack to 64 in this version
- Eggs can stack to 64 in this version

**Alpha 1.2.0**
- Zombie Pigmen and skeletons appear to hold their weapons but it is all visual, updating these two mobs past 1.3 will turn them into weaponless weaponless mobs
- Lava only flows 4 blocks in the nether

**Alpha 1.2.2**
- In this version it is possible to get to the Farlands in under an hour. The way to do this is to summon a nether portal and place a boat in it, get into the boat, and once you go through the nether the game will become glitched and you will become stuck in the nether portal animation. Save and Quit the game, and when you load back in you will be at the same coordinates in the nether as you were in the overworld. When you generate another portal and go through your coordinates in the overworld will be multiplied 8 times. Doing this over again will cause your coords to multiply 8 types each time until you are all the way at the farlands
- Nether Portals can be summoned by pressing F4 which can be used to get to the Farlands and to create illegal block formations
- Signs can be placed on the Nether Portal Tile

**Alpha 1.2.6**
- Lava Lakes are able to cut through bedrock if spawned at the bottom of the world

**Beta 1.3.2 - Infdev 20100624**
> [!Note]
> In order to access this version, the world save folder will have to be named as World[1-5]. During this downgrade, the level.dat and level.dat_old should be removed temporarily. A world without a level.dat can be accessed by selecting the respective slot when going to the singleplayer screen. The level.dat and level.dat_old will have to be restored when updating back to b1.3-2 in order to preserve the Alpha File Format folders of the next version. No chunks, entities, or placed blocks will be affected during this downgrade.	
- This version has a file format that is not used in any other version. A folder named "data" is used, and contains "entities.dat" and "zones.dat" This folder will become completely unused upon updating out of this version and nothing will be converted to a different file format. This creates several file discontinued features. 

**Beta 1.2_02-launcher**
- This is the last version that uses the Alpha file format. Since the Alpha File Format from the original world has already been converted, updating to this version will regenerate an entirely new world with the Alpha File Format. This allows for numerous folders in both the world save folder and the DIM-1 folder, that are titled with numbers and letters, which contain subfolders titled with numbers and letters, that contain .dat files, since this is how the Alpha File Format worked. There are hundreds of discontinued folders possible. 	

**Beta 1.3-2**
- Petrified Oak Slabs were added in this version, they can be simply crafted using the normal oak slab recipe and later they will become Petrified Oak Slabs
- World names can contain the section symbol § and will format the name which will become unobtainable in later versions.
- After respawning or initial spawning into a world you will be given a stack of torches, a pickaxe, an axe, a shovel, 1 bed, and then a stack of 63 beds, this will create unobtainable overstacked beds which will be unobtainble in later versions.
- Because the Chest is a full block you are able to power blocks through chests. The best way to so that is by the repeater
- Blowing up a Chest while spam clicking an item in and out of the chest has a chance of dropping a zero stack item which can give you understacked items
- Placing a redstone torch against a unsupportable block adjacent to a valid supporting block or against the ceiling next to a supporting block, these would allow the redstone torch to float on any block including air or itself.
- Placing a bed next to a cactus would result in the lower half adjacent to cactus breaking from Beta 1.3 to Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5.
- You can paste ASCII Control Codes and the DEL Character into the world name. Beware that with some control characters, backspacing too many times after pasting them can cause a game crash in some versions. 

**Beta 1.4-1** 
- Locked Chests can generate throughout the world if your computer time is set to April 1st, 2011. You can obtain them from explosions, they will convert to stained glass in the future allowing for several illegal block formations

**Beta 1.6-tb3**
> [!Note]
> The level.dat and level.dat_old will need to be removed, either temporarily or permanetly in order to allow for the test build chests to generate in this version. In order to access the world after removing level.dat, you can go to create world and create a world with the same name as the world save. It is also recommended to use the same seed to prevent chunk borders. It is recommended to replace the original level.dat after entering this version in order to preserve the discontinued world name from the previous versions.
- Upon level.dat creation, debug chests would generate at the world spawn and contain every item in the game at the time including illegal items. These items include Half Bed, Flowing Water, Water, Flowing Lava, Lava, Double Stone Slab, Fire, Redstone Wire, Crops, Farmland, Lit Furnace, Standing Sign, Wall Sign, Half Wooden Door, Half Iron Door, Lit Redstone Ore, Unlit Redstone Torch, Reeds, Portal, Cake Block, Unpowered Redstone Repeater, Powered Redstone Repeater, Locked Chest, Shrub, and Bedrock
- Melting Ice in the nether won't dissolve the water making it possible to have water in the nether
- Entering a Nether Portal while in the crafting grid will cause all items in the crafting grid to get thrown out and become 0 stacked items, 0 stack items can be subtracted to become negative stack items by Q-ing them and can be overflowed to become overstacked items
- Update Suppresion now works by using budding redstone updates, you can find the world download in the "Mods & Extra Files" Folder for the Update Suppresor Model for this version
- Maps would not snap to a grid, meaning unobtainable map variants can be obtained

**Beta 1.6.0**
- Dropping any equipment that was damaged creates a zero stack. This item can picked up any number of times and fills up the player's inventory quickly. This method only works on tools, armor, and weapons that have durability.

**Beta 1.7**
- Block Transmutation can work by building a piston and water based contraption
- Block Transmutation can also work with an arrow and piston contraption
- Pulling a detector rail with a minecart on it will leave it powered, though will only temporarily as it will be reverted once ticked
- Pushing with a 0/1-tick pulse or by simply pulling a rail or activator rail off a block it would leave it floating in mid air.

**1.7_01**
- Placing an upwards facing piston of any type, and building a two block high pillar of solid blocks right besides the piston, and place a lever on the top block, in such a way that the lever is right above the piston. Activating this lever will crash the game, and you world will not be able to be opened again in b1.7_01. Update to b1.7.2, and load the world. There will now be a block-entity less moving piston block (Block 36) above the piston.

**Beta 1.7.2**
- Block Transmutation can work by updating a budded piston at the same time another piston pushes a block merging the blocks

**Beta 1.8 Prerelease 1-1**
- Endermen can pick up any block in the game allowing for discontinued endermen variants
- Enderpearls can stack up to 64 in this version allowing for overstacked enderpearls
- Updating a furnace into a lit furnace which will update a piston and then pushing the furnace will displace it's block entity. This allows for furnace block entity in any block in the game that normally has a block entity
- Placing a mushroom on any block and then bonemealing them would grow a big mushroom and replace the block underneath it with dirt making it possible for unbreakable bock removal
- Updating a Chest from Beta 1.7.3 will cause it to be a darkness block inside the chest because previously chests were opaque and a full block. Any block changes around the chest will break it.

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 1**
- Jumping will give you XP, this is not an unobtainable but it is a debug feature that can be used to get insane amount of Xp levels really quickly

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 (MOD)**
> [!Note]
> This version uses a mod to assign a block id to a cauldron in order to access the original brewing system. The beta 1.9 pre2 cauldron mod can be downloaded from resources. The zip file can then be extracted, and the folder titled "enable" can be zipped. This enabled zip can then be added to a b1.9-pre2 instance in multimc by going to edit instance and add to minecraft.jar. You can find this mod in the "Mods & Extra Files" folder
- The cauldron currently uses the id of an enchantment table and the block data of a brewing stand. This means that updating out of this version will convert the cauldron to an enchantment table with the block data of a brewing stand
- Potions can be brewed by adding an assortment of ingredients to a cauldron. A total of 5,339 potion variations are possible using this method, most of which provide discontinued status effects and create invalid data value potions. A potion calculator is included on the resource sheet to explain the brewing process in more detail. 
- Feeding animals would cause the wheat to decrement past 0 if it was the last item in the stack

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 - Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2**
- Downgrading potions from Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 to Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 will make it possible to overstack the potions allowing for overstacked potions

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3-1**
> [!Note]
> Certain multiplayer exclusive chunks can be obtained, however it requires file manipulation. Regions from a newly generated multiplayer world can be copied into the pre-existing world. This would work by taking a region file, changing the numbers to not conflict with previously existing region files, and adding them to the preexisting world.
- The player would spawn with debug items including a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portals, and end portal frames. Hovering your cursor over the end portals will crash your game due to a missing tooltip
- Blowing up end portal frames that generate in the stronghold have a 30% chance of dropping themselves
- Enchanting Items in this version will give it the Enchantment "ENCHANTED!", updating these items to newer versions would cause the enchants on the gear to be converted to Feather Falling I allowing for Feather Falling I on all tools and gear.
- Currently "Sky Dimension" chunks generate in a new multiplayer world. These are large floating islands that generate in the overworld, with large sections of void and no bedrock. There is no way to obtain these chunks in a pre-existing world, however the region files can be moved from a newly generated multiplayer world to the preexisting world by renumbering the newly generated region files

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4-1**
- Enchanting in this version works normally and all previous enchants would convert to Feather Falling I, however Silk Touch and Fortune are not mutually exclusive allowing for Silk Touch and Fortune on the same tool
- Silk Touch works on Spawners, Infested Stone, Lit Furnaces, Double Slabs, Lit Redstone Ore, and Ice which all become unobtainable in newer versions
- Placing a support block on a glass block will misplace the support block somewhere where it can be placed, using this method you can place support blocks on chests which can give you unobtainable block formations

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6**
- The exit portal would generate when the ender dragon is killed but the exit portal would generate where the dragon died and not at 0,0 allowing for the exit end portal in discontinued locations
- Nether Portal can be placed in the end, allowing for nether portals in the end
- The player can try to place a torch or redstone torch on a block that is situated next to the world border (where you are not supposed to place a torch). This will result in the torch going onto the world border.

**1.0.0 Release Candidate 1**
- In this version, all swords have 5 durability points. Updating any swords with 1 durability point remaining, and combining them in this version causes these swords to gain negative durability once updated. This allows for negative durability wooden, stone, iron, gold, diamond, and eventually netherite swords
- Shooting from a bow that has 0 durability can cause the bow to become a zero stack.

**11w49a**
- Pressing B changes the clientside gamemode to creative. This allows for Bedrock, Sponge, Chainmail Armor, Ice, and Creeper, Skeleton, Spider, Zombie, Slime, Ghast, Pig Zombie, Enderman, Cave Spider, Silverfish, Blaze, Magma Cube, Pig, Sheep, Cow, Chicken, Squid, Wolf, Mooshroom, and Villager Spawn Eggs. This also allows for easy bedrock removal.
- Using spawn eggs for mobs with weapons (e.g Skeleton, and Pig Zombie) for the B Creative Mode will spawn them without weapons

**1.1**
- The unicode delete character [] can be typed into a world name by pressing ctrl + backspace. This is the only version where a world can be named with both the delete character [] and the section symbol [§], making this the ideal version to name your world.

**12w07a**
- The file format is now Anvil instead of MCRegion. This converts all .mcr files to .mca, however the .mcr files are maintained within the world save folder for all three dimensions. Additionally, a level.dat backup is taken named level.dat_mcr. These are all discontinued files.
- The End in this version does not generate with any main end island it is just you and the void. Additionally when you kill the ender dragon the exit portal will spawn where the dragon died instead of at 0.0

**12w08a**
- Iron Golems current have no knockback resistance which will not revert when updating to newer versions allowing for discontinued variants of the iron golem
- Spawning an Iron Golem would remove the block above it meaning you can uses this as bedrock removal

**0.982 Classroom (EDU)**
- Added Information Block, Information Sign, Spawn Block, Build Allow Block, Build Disallow Block, Border Block, Foundation Block, Teleport Block. These are all obtainable through creative mode or the /give command and they all have the ids of 137-144. Some of these items will convert to unobtainable blocks, the Build Disallow Block would convert to a command block, the information sign converted to a flower pot item, the border block would convert to the carrot tile item, the spawn block would convert to the potato tile item, the teleport item would convert to a mob head item, and the build allow block will convert to a beacon.
- There is a teacher menu that allows for the teacher to enter creative mode and also gives numerous discontinued items.
- Currently any command can be run by joining the game as a teacher all while being in survival mode.
- A feature called the fill tool is toggleable. This allows for two locations to be selected and then filled with blocks. This allows for various discontinued block configurations, including multiple chests and floating buttons.
- A file called EduWorldSettings.ini is generated within the world save. A folder called MCEdu is created within the world save, which includes a file named signLocations_en.ini and a file named tips_en.txt. Within the MCEdu folder a file called infoLocations_en.ini is created when an information block is placed and the game is saved. The teleportLocations_en.ini, teleportLocations.ini, and allowedteleports.ini files are created when a station block is placed and the game is saved. These files and folders are exclusive to Edu versions, and will be discontinued in future versions. 
- Player data is saved in the players folder under username.dat. Additionally, server.log and server.log.lck are created within the world folder. The server log contains the entire chat output. These files are multiplayer exclusive, and will become discontinued in future versions.

**12w15a**
- Shift click works with brewing stands. This allows for overstacked glass bottles in brewing stand.

**12w17a-2**
- Chunk resetting is possible by overloading a chunk with written books. It requires over a chest of books filled with random unicode characters. This allows for an assortment of block discontinued features and item duplication. This will be further utilized in later versions.
- The title for written books is currently 16 characters which later will be updated to 15
- Pressing enter inside a book and quill creates a newline character, but it does not advance the line. This allows for a total of up to 256 newline characters, which is far more than will be allowed in future versions.
- When written books were first added to Minecraft, they had a severe flaw in their server side logic to check against potentially malicious client input. This flaw allows one to place nearly any NBT they desire onto a book and quill or written book. When written books were first added to Minecraft, they had a severe flaw in their server side logic to check against potentially malicious client input. This flaw allows one to place nearly any NBT they desire onto a book and quill or written book. The Clients can be found in the Mods folder, BookMod can be used from 1.3-1.4.2 and the EnchantedSigning mod can be used from 1.4 to 1.4.2
- You were able to format book & quills in this version using the formatting symbol §
- Carriage Return characters can be copy pasted in written books
- You could make minecarts have an infinite fire texture on them by making them quickly touch fire. Starting with 12w18a (1.3.1), minecarts no longer display this texture, but updating these minecarts to current versions shows that they have a 'Fire' property of 300, when normally they should have `Fire` at 0, or 160 if they quickly touch fire without being destroyed in current versions. 

**12w21a**
- Villagers now have trades. Every single villager trade will become unobtainable in future versions, whether through invalid prices or invalid items. Villager trades are not based on tiers and trade amounts can vary. Eyes of enders and rotten flesh can currently be bought, which will no longer be possible in the next two versions. Bottles of enchanting are obtainable through trading now.
- When creating a new world, if the name picked matches a current world folder name, additional characters will be added to the new folder name. The actual world name will only be the original picked name, which must be within the 32 character limit. However, if the game closes out while generating the world, the folder name will be applied to the world name, regardless of the folder name length. From 12w18a through 19w11b, world names would uses dashes after the name, and from 19w12a+ a number in parentheses is added to the end. The longest possible name is a bit complicated to figure out, since it is limited to the longest possible folder name, and the maximum length of the folder name is determined by the length of the file path, which is limited to 248 characters. Due to the version range,

**12w22a-2**
- Added the gravel to flint trade and the sell arrow trade, which will become discontinued in certain amounts in future versions. The cleric villager can now enchant armor, which will all become discontinued trades. Eyes of ender are now sold instead of bought, which will become unobtainable in a future version.
- Block Transmutation is possible by using tripwires allowing for various unobtainable blocks

**12w24a**
- Shift Clicking a stacked item into an enchantment table will remove the nbt data of the item including written books allowing for various discontinued features

**0.984 Classroom (EDU)**
- A file called EduWorldSettings.ini is generated within the world save. A folder called MCEdu is created within the world save, which includes several files that are gnenerated when the server is launched. These files and folders are exclusive to Edu versions, and will be discontinued in future versions.

**12w32a-2**
- Equipment droped from mobs ranges in durability. The durability can be 0 which allows for various 0 durabilit equipment pieces
- Zombie Pigmen that spawn in this version appear to be holding the correct items, but in reality they are holding zombie gear (iron shovels, iron swords, or nothing)
- Pigs that are struck by lightning will spawn Zombie Pigmen that are holding nothing
- Villagers now trade different arrow and paper amounts which will become unobtainable in future versions.
- Within the data folder, the villages.dat file now generates. This file tracks player made villages, and will become discontinued in future versions
- The center of a map would be aligned on the location the map was crafted. This was changed in 12w34a, where maps would now align to a grid, regardless of crafting location. Therefore maps with center locations that do not fit the grid are all discontinued.

**12w34a**
- Multiple Item frames can be placed on the same block which will become unobtainable in future versions

**12w34b**
- Added the canpickuploot tag for mobs. Mobs such as skeletons and zombie pigmen with this tag can pick up item stacks larger than 127 items, which causes them to lose their held item. Skeletons and zombie pigmen holding nothing will become unobtainable in future versions

**12w37a**
- Wither can explode end portal frames when spawned which results in end portal frame removal.
- Mobs that burn in sunlight and can wear helmets occasionally do not check the durability of the damage caused to their helmets.

**12w41a**
- Anvils can rename an item to have no characters and all spaces which will become unobtainable in future versions

**12w42a**
- Number Keys can be used to place items anywhere, this allows for invalid items in furnace slots, brewing stands, and armor slots

**1.4.4**
- Baby mobs can be spawned by using spawn eggs on the parents. So using a wolf spawn egg on an ownerless wolf creates an ownerless baby wolf which will become unobtainable in future versions
- Support Blocks could be placed on End Portal Frames because they were considered full blocks

**12w49a**
- Any item can be enchanted using an anvil. This will provide a variety of unobtainable enchanted items
- Enchanted Books can be overstacked, after they are overstacked they can be shift-clicked into an enchantment table allowing for no nbt enchanted books
- Shears can be enchanted with Silk Touch

**12w49a - 12w41a (Downgrade)**
- All items with invalid enchantments can be combined in an anvil. Downgrading these items from the previous version allows for multiple enchantments on individual items.

**12w50a**
- Enchanted Books can have invalid tier levels when updating
- There is a small chance that level 5 enchanted book trades can cost more than 64 emeralds, which will become a discontinued trade.

**13w01a**
- Hoppers are currently capable of placing items in any inventory slots, allowing for invalid items in brewing stands and invalid items in furnace slots. By placing items not normal craftable in a furnace output slot, these items can register as crafted by statistics in future versions.
- Daylight sensors can be placed in the nether and will permanently powered on
- Hanging redstone torches were able to float when the block they are attached to was removed, as long as they had a block underneath them
- Placing a rail on a block that is inside of an end portal will leave the rail floating on top of the end portal block

**13w06a-1**
- All minecarts will be converted to spawner minecarts which will become unobtainable later
- Spawner minecarts can be used for future chunk regeneration. By moving a spawner minecart into a chunk from this version through 1.10.2, and leaving it unloaded until 1.13-pre2 or later, the chunk containing the minecart will regenerate.

**13w11a**
- Silk Touch and Looting can be combined on one enchanted book, this is unobtainable in future versions

**Minecraft 2.0-Red (April Fools)**
- In Super Hostile Mode, lightning will strike every 2-5 minutes spawning Wool Headed Zombies, Wool Headed Skeletons, and Wool Haded Zombie Pigmen and Pigmen with Battle Signs among many others, pushing these mobs into a portal will cause them to not despawn when the lightning strike resets, you can then update to 13w16b to obtain name tags and name all the wool headed mobs and save them for future updates
- Zombie Pigmen will spawn naturally in the nether holding Battle Signs, these Battle signs would hold certain enchantments including Sharpness/Smite/Bane of Arthropods, Looting, Fire Aspect, and Knockback. Killing the pigmen will give a chance of dropping the Battle Sign

**13w16a-2**
- Horse armor is craftable, and stacks to 64, allowing for overstacked horse armor in future versions.
- Horse saddles will convert to armor stands in future versions, allowing for a variety of discontinued features associted to armor stands, including armor stands in the furnace fuel slot and overstacked armor stands.
- Added Horses, Donkeys, and Mules. These mobs can have much faster speed values than future versions, as well as jump values that will become discontinued in the future.

**13w21a**
- Updating Mobs from this version into future version will allow for unobtainable variants of mobs due to speed change
- You can saddle and put armor on wild horses in this version

**1.6.3-1**
- Bounding boxes now save with the world. In order for current structures (witch huts, nether fortresses, etc.) to be saved to the world file, the player must load the appropriate chunks within the game manually. After this is completed, structures will be compatible in all snapshots starting with snapshot. All these bounding boxes will not be obtainable in their current locations in future versions.
- These bounding boxes are stored in structure files, which are generated when the respective structure is loaded. These files are Village.dat, Fortress.dat, Temple.dat, Mineshaft.dat, and Stronghold.dat. All of these files will be discontinued in a future version.

**1.6.4 Build 1 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- A file called forcedchunks.dat generates within the world save folder, which will become unobtainable in non edu versions

**13w36a-1**
- A method of block transmutation is now possible. This method works by firing an arrow, then pushing the arrow with a piston so it is floating, and then breaking the block it was previously on and replacing it with a golden pressure plate. This allows for several invalid data value blocks, and an easy form of update suppression by creating 6 sided pistons
- Crafting a Carrot on a Stick with a Fishing Rod that is enchanted with Lure and Luck of the Sea allowing for a Carrot on A Stick with Lure and Luck of the Sea enchantments
- Silk Touch and Luck of the Sea can be applied on the same enchanted book
- Currently reloading a villager removes the second buy slot item. This allows for free enchantment trades on clerics and it only costs a book for an enchanted book, as well as gravel to flint conversion for free. These will all be unobtainable trades in future versions.
- Statistics do not track data values. This means that when crafting any color dye, it increases the statistic for ink sacs. The ink sac crafted statistic will be unobtainable in future verions.
- Items and blocks that are normally unobtainable can have various statistics associated with them, allowing for discontinued statistics by extension. Examples include bedrock placed. There is also the special case of command blocks placed. In future versions command blocks will no longer be able to be placed in survival, meaning that the statistic is both discontinued by block type and by statistic value.
- Enchantments are not applied properly either through anvils of enchanting tables, resulting in items with an empty enchantment tag. These items all have a discontinued nbt tag by having no enchantments yet still having the enchantments tag.
- The empty enchantments also apply to villager trades, allowing for cleric villagers to sell enchanted armor without enchantments. This trade will become unobtainable in future versions.
- In 14w02a (1.8 snapshot) the crafting recipe of doors was changed from 1 door to 3 doors. So if you craft a door in this version, it will only give you one, messing up the statistic, crafting doors in this version will cause the statistic to be uneven multiple of 3 so door statistics of 4 and 5 are possible
- Just like the Doors from above, in this version you can only craft fences two at a time instead of 3 in future versions allowing for unobtainable statistic of fences so it is possible to have a statistic of 5 for fences crafted
- You can get an unobtainable Player Kills statistic if you are in singleplayer by shooting yourself with an arrow or harming potions till you die
- Combining Chain Armor, Tridents, or Elytra to repair them will cause the statistic of items crafted to go up one for each respective item, since none of them can be crafted, this becomes an unobtainable stastistic

**13w37a**
- Enchanted Books in loot table chests do not have enchantments
- Chunk regeneration can occur by mining a powered redstone lamp with silk touch. This allows for an assortment of unobtainable block configurations.
- Removed several technical blocks, these are: bed (26), piston head and extension (34 & 36), redstone wire (55), wheat crops (59), standing and wall sign (63 & 68), wooden and iron door (64 & 71), lit redstone ore (74), unlit redstone torch (75), sugar cane (83), cake (92), unpowered and powered repeater (93 & 94), locked chest (95), pumpkin and melon stem (104 & 105), nether wart (115), brewing stand (117), cauldron (118), lit redstone lamp (124), tripwire (132), flower pot (140), skull (144), and unpowered and powered comparator (149 & 150). The locked chest will convert to stained glass in the future if it is kept unloaded until the addition of stained glass.

**13w37b**
- Bounding boxes now save with the world. In order for current structures (witch huts, nether fortresses, etc.) to be saved to the world file, the player must load the appropriate chunks within the game manually. After this is completed, structures will be compatible in all snapshots starting with snapshot. All these bounding boxes will not be obtainable in their current locations in future versions.
- These bounding boxes are stored in structure files, which are generated when the respective structure is loaded. These files are Village.dat, Fortress.dat, Temple.dat, Mineshaft.dat, and Stronghold.dat. All of these files will be discontinued in a future version.

**13w49a**
- Added Chicken Jockeys. Chickens in chicken jockeys currently lay eggs, as the "IsJockey" tag does not exist yet. Chickens also maintain agression against the player after the zombie is dead, despite not being able to deal damage.
- Zombies, zombie villagers, and zombie pigmen (if made weaponless first) chicken jockeys could pick up eggs from 13w49a to 1.7.10.

**1.7.10 Build 1 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- Player data is saved in the playerdata folder under username.dat. This will become unobtainable in future versions as it is stored as a UUID instead of a username. Additionally, since you are logging in in offline mode, the UUID for the statistics is different, allowing for multiple statistic files in a singleplayer world.

**1.7.10 Build 20 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- Command computers can be used to run any command in the game. This is different to the teachers menu in that this can be acheived by a non op player by using the command computer datapack linked in "Mods & Extra Files". It can also be obtained in survival without using the teacher menu or commands by downgrading prismarine.
- The disk drive, wireless modem, monitor, printer, and advanced monitor all have the numeric id of 166, and data values of 0,1,2,3, and 4, respectively. The numeric id of 166 later converts to barriers, which are unobtainable in survival by normal means. Updating these items allows for both normal barriers and invalid data value barriers to be obtained.
- The computer process allows for the writing of external files, meaning essentially any file can be created within the world save, all of which would be discontinued. Upon world save the computer folder is generated, which is a discontinued folder.

**1.7.10**
- Placing Skulls against non full blocks and can replace the block in front of it with a skull and will not cause block updates making it possible for Skull Suppresion

**14w02a**
- Completely reworked villager trades. Almost all trades will be discontinued in future versions, either by trade, amount, or tier it is within. Some specific trades that will be discontinued are: Shepherds Selling All 16 Wool Colors, Librarians Buying 2 Written Books, and Leatherworkers Selling Enchanted Leather Tunic. Trades are now generated based on tier and are more specifically ordered. All trades from previous versions are considered tier 0 trades, meaning all trades from this version can be stacked on top of trades from previous versions.
- Clerics currently buy enderpearls, which will become unobtainable in future versions.
- Clerics currently sell eyes of enders, which ill become unobtainable in future versions
- Currently the files village_nether.dat and villages_end.dat generate in the data folder. These are discontinued files.
- Data is again stored by username instead of UUID. This allows for a statistic file with the players username that will not convert to a UUID. This also means that statistics will not be accurately tracked during this version. This occurs because the change to UUID was based on real world time instead of version ordering.
- In 14w02a (a 1.8 snapshot), farmer villagers were supposed to sell cake at tier 4. However, due to a bug farmer villagers will instead sell the Cake (Block Item) for 1 emerald. As the cake block does not have a registered item in 13w37a (a 1.7 snapshot) and above, opening this villager's GUI before reloading from disk after unlocking its tier 4 trades will crash the game whilst trying to write the villager's trades to the trade packet. When the villager is saved to disk, 0 is written as the item id, converting it to air.
- Due to a bug, from 14w02a - 14w30c (1.8 Snapshots) bottles o' enchanting were unavailable as a last tier trade from cleric villagers.

**14w02a - 1.7.10 (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading villagers from 14w02a causes all trades to become tier 0 trades. This would allow you to update back to 14w02a, and get the same trades stacked on top. This downgrade and update cycle can be repeated for well over 100 trades in the first tier. This also allows for villagers of different careers to have trades on the same villager (for example shepherd trades and fletcher trades can both be on the same villager using this bug)

**14w04a**
- The id for cooked fish is now "cooked_fish" instead of "cooked_fished" This change partially breaks old villagers trading fish, but no discontinued trades are created. These broken villagers will allow for chunk regeneration in future versions, and by extension discontinued block configurations.
- Placing Snow on grass would not convert the grass to snowy grass

**14w21a**
- By update suppressing a container and then placing items within that container, a technique known as item shadowing can be performed, which allows for duplicate item references. Along with item duplication, this allows for the same item to be placed inside an enchantment table at the same time, allowing for duplicate enchantments on any item that can be placed in an enchanting table.

**14w25a**
- A Wet sponge can be placed in the nether and will not update to Dry Sponge
- Removed the item forms of flowing and stationary water and lava blocks (8, 9, 10 & 11), double stone and wooden slabs (43 & 125), fire blocks (51), Nether portal and End portal blocks (90 & 119), cocoa pods (127), and potato and carrot crops (141 & 142)
- Torches can be placed in an assortment of invalid locations, including floating, on other torches, and on transparent blocks, all of which are discontinued block configurations. This occurs by placing them on a block that is against a solid block, instead of changing the position to a wall torch, the position is maintained as a standing torch.
- Mining the piston hwad in this version will not break the rest of the piston but instead leav you with a headless piston

**14w26c**
- Furnaces can now only have fuel items, and empty and water buckets in the fuel slot. Mushroom blocks are still considered fuel and can be placed in the fuel slot, which will be discontinued in future versions.

**14w27a**
- There is a 1 in 1000 chance of a killer bunny spawning in place of a rabbit. This is an unobtainable mob.
- Rabbits currently spawn with 10 health, which will be reduced in future versions, making these rabbits discontinued
- The killer bunny is capable of killing the player, allowing for the "Killed By Rabbit" statistic, which is discontinued by association with the killer bunny
- Placing buttons puts them into a perpetual pressed state. Placing comparators puts them into a powered state regardless of redstone input. These are both unobtainable block states.
- Placing an iron trapdoor places it in an open state, but with powered as false. This is a discontinued combination of block states.

**14w27b-2**
- Planting Pumpkin and Melon seeds will cause them to be planted full grown and always facing east

**14w28b**
- Spawners can now be right clicked with a spawn egg, and they will spawn that mob. This allows for an assortment of discontinued mob spawners.

**14w30b**
- Breaking a placed banner adds a block entity tag to the item

**14w32a**
- Minecarts can pick up armor stands
- Horse saddles from 13w16a can be updated and will convert to armor stands, allowing for armor stands in the furnace fuel slot.
- Currently overstacked armor can be dispensed onto an armor stand, which will be discontinued in future versions. This was removed in 24w09a so you will have to keep the armor stand in unloaded chunks till 1.20.5 Prerelease 1
- Currently placed armor stands have minor poses. In future versions armor stands will have no poses, making these discontinued armor stand variants.

**15w14a**
> [!Note]
> In order to update to this version, the world folder must be renamed to "existence.af15"
- Attempting to trade with a villager does not give the proper item, but instead gives a paper renamed "Thanks for your donation". This paper is a discontinued item since it is renamed without a repair cost.
- Horses could be stacked on top of the player by right clicking them. They can be removed from riding the player by logging out, or submerging the stack into water. While both tamed and untamed horses could be added to the stack, untamed horses will randomly dismount their mounts, making them a temporary discontinued feature if the stack consists of untamed horses.

**1.8.9**
- Currently there is a bug that allows for commands to be run in survival. This is known as Cross Word Commands, and it functions by first creating a creative world. From the creative world a redstone setup can be made to generate a large amount of lag at the same time it runs command blocks. The player then quickly logs out of the creative world and into the survival world, which has a chance to transfer the commands and have them run in survival. A creative world download will be added to "Mods & Extra Files"
- During this version armored mobs can be stored in unloaded chunks until 18w19a or later. Keeping these mobs unloaded during this version range will create dual wielding mobs, or mobs holding boots and leggings in each hand. This allows for unobtainable mob variants. During this version, mobs can also be stored in unloaded chunks until 15w32a or later for mobs with 0 drop chance on their left hand.

**1.8.9 Build 3 Classroom (EDU)**
- Player data is saved in the playerdata folder under username.dat. This will become unobtainable in future versions as it is stored as a UUID instead of a username. Additionally, since you are logging in in offline mode, the UUID for the statistics is different, allowing for multiple statistic files in a singleplayer world.
- Files called EduWorldSettings.ini, EduMapSettings.ini, and forcedchunks.dat generate within the world save. A folder called MCEdu is created within the world save, which includes several files that are gnenerated when the server is launched. Another folder called region_eduf1_backup is created upon world save, and contains a copy of the region files. These files and folders are exclusive to Edu versions, and will be discontinued in future versions.
- The computer process allows for the writing of external files, meaning essentially any file can be created within the world save, all of which would be discontinued. Upon world save the computer folder is generated, which is a discontinued folder.

**15w31a**
- Endermen now drop the block they are holding, allowing for an assortment of items that are normally unobtainable if the endermen from b1.8-pre1 are killed.
- Enchanting a book in an enchantment table does not properly apply the enchantment, resulting in a blank enchanted book. This will become unobtainable in future versions.
- Enchanted books that generate in structures have no enchantments, which allows for blank enchanted books. This will become unobtainable in future versions.
- A potion tag can be added to any item within a brewing stand. Updating brewing stands that contain any item in the output slots into this version, and then brewing a potion, will add the potion tag to any item, allowing for discontinued nbt tags. This same method also converts all items within the brewing stand to a data value of 0, allowing for simple item transmutation.
- When the dragon is resummoned, it generates a new end portal at 0 0, which can exist alongside the previous portal from earlier versions, thus allowing multiple end portals in the world.
- Books have extra characters added when they are signed, which allows for written books with extra characters
- Building a creeper face out of clay resummons the dragon. This allows for more than one dragon at a time, which is a discontinued amount of ender dragons.
- By removing nbt data from a spawn egg, either through brewing stand item transmutation or by shift clicking a spawn egg into an enchantment table, a no nbt spawn egg can be created. By using a spawn egg with no nbt on a spawner, a spawner missing nbt data can be created
- When building a creeper face, a 6x6 block of clay is removed. This however removes all blocks in this 6x6 area, including bedrock. This is a form of bedrock removal.
- Currently resummoning dragons will regenerate the dragon egg, which allows for a normally unobtainable amount of dragon eggs.
- Since 15w31a (first snapshot of 1.9) regenerating the exit portal by either killing or respawning the ender dragon would delete the blocks around it allowing for many fun things like half beds, doors and floating plants, rails, torches, gravity blocks and such until 17w47a 

**15w32a**
- Loading the mobs stored in 1.8.9 will create 0 drop chance left hand mobs

**15w33a**
- Added items picked up and items dropped statistics. These can go negative by simply dropping or picking up negative stacks of items.

**15w33c**
- Inside End City Ships instead of an Elytra a book signed by Searge generates. This is unobtainable in singleplayer.
- Fireballs shot out of a dispenser are dragon fireballs. This allows for dragon fireballs in the overworld and nether, which can become frozen projectiles. These projectiles are normally unobtainable in these dimensions.
- Resummoning the ender dragon also regenerates the end pillars. The ender crystals can be moved during this regeneration process, allowing for indestructable ender crystals which will be unobtainable in future versions.

**15w35a**
- Zombies and Zombie Pigmen spawn in this version with noAI. This allows for various NoAI mobs including Villagers and Drowneds
- From 15w34a (1.9 snapshot) to 1.12.1[1], and 1.13 to 1.13.2[2], being inside of a nether portal and throwing an ender pearl will multiply the player's coordinates by ⅛ if performed in the Overworld, or 8 if performed in the Nether. This can be done to easily reach the world border. This is safest to perform on the nether roof, because the player can be spawned inside of a wall if performed below the roof, or take a dip into a lava lake. The same may happen in the overworld, but performing the warp at a Y level higher than most terrain (y=100 typically is sufficient) will cause the pearl to simply fall to the surface, allowing for safe teleportation

**15w35d**
- By placing 256 block states in a single chunk, the chunk can corrupt and potentially replace random blocks, potentially allowing for various discontinued blocks

**15w37a**
- Pistons can no longer push pistons, but can instead push obsidian. Pushing obsidian into the world border allows for block 36 with obsidian, which is unobtainable in future versions

**15w38a**
- Armor from skeleton horsemen have a chance of having duplicate enchantments or conflicting enchantments. In future versions duplicate enchantments will be removed. This allows for Helmets and bows with conflicting enchantments.
- Sending a skeleton trapped horse to the nether allows for wither skeleton horsemen, which are unobtainable in future versions
- Skeleton horses currently spawn with higher health than is obtainable in future versions. The main skeleton horse spawns with 53 hp, and the other skeleton horses range from 15-30 hp

**15w39a**
- Using a Bucket on a block destroys the block possible for bedrock removal

**15w41a**
- Currently any mobs can enter into a boat, this includes large mobs such as ghasts, and squids. This allows for an assortment of discontinued mobs in boats.
- An ender dragon can enter a boat, which will be discontinued in future versions
- Clerics now sell ender pearls instead of eye of enders, which is another discontinued trade

**15w42a - 15w41b**
- Downgrading a frost walker enchanted book to this version allows you to add a depth strider book to it via an anvil. These enchantments are usually mutually exclusive, thus allowing for a discontinued enchanted book combination.

**15w42a**
- Mending and Infinity can be added to a bow and an enchanted book
- Adding Blaze powder to a Brewing Stand will set the fuel higher than in newer versions
- trading with a librarian in 15w42a and getting either a Mending or Frost Walker enchanted book trade. Mending and Frost Walker I would be 5-19 emeralds and one book each. This was changed in the next version so it would cost 10-38 emeralds and one book. Similarly in 15w42a Frost Walker II would cost 8-32 emeralds and one book, where in the next snapshot it would cost 16-64 emeralds and one book.
- Currently renaming any item adds the repair cost 0 tag, which will not be added to renamed items in future versions
- From 15w42a to 15w44b, breaking frosted ice with a Silk Touch pickaxe will drop tile.air.name. This cannot be picked up by player, but it can be picked up by minecart with hopper, from which you can move it to hopper and then into other containers.

**1.9 Prerelease 1 - 16w07b (Downgrading)**
- By downgrading a shield from the previous version, negative durability shields can be created. This works by taking at least two shields in the previous version, and getting the durability lower than roughly 140 at least. The lower the durability, the easier to combine. Once these low durability shields are obtained, they can be downgraded to this version and combined in a crafting table. This will make the shields receive a lower durability, and can consistently be combined to as low as roughly -32400 durability. Anything lower than roughly -160 durability will remain negative when updated.

**1.RV- Prerelease 1**

- Any spider spawned in a cold biome with direct sky access could become a stray jockey instead of a normal spider jockey. The biome can be Snowy Tundra, Snowy Mountains, Ice Spikes, Frozen River, or Frozen Ocean. There is a 0.8% chance that any spider spawned will be a stray jockey. The spider can be only spawned from a spawner, or using a spawn egg, as natural spawning couldn't spawn jockeys at the time due to bug.

**16w21a**
- Dispensers can equip shields onto entities, including armor stands.

**1.10.2**
- Spawner minecarts can be moved into various chunks and kept unloaded until 1.13-pre2 or later, and then will be capable of regenerating chunks when loaded

- Endermen could pick up snowy grass. They could also place it down and it would keep the state. If an enderman places or picks up snowy grass in a future version it simply converts to regular grass.
- The crafting statistic does not actually count the action of crafting, instead it counts when the item is taken from the output slot of either a crafting table or furnace. Therefore, any item taken out of the output slot of a furnace adds to the crafting stat of that item. If items are placed in a furnace output slot by any means (See invalid items in furnace under Indev 20100219), and then taken out in any version from 17w47a to 1.21.8 (present) the item will increase the respective crafting statistic.

- Snowballs stack to 64, allowing for overstacked snowballs in this version
- Added the chopping enchantment. This enchantment can exist on enchanted books and on axes, and will not be obtainable in future versions. This also extends to villager trades, allowing for librarians and weaponsmiths trading chopping enchanted equipment. The chopping enchantment will be removed in future versions, however this still allows for a variant of trade where an unenchanted item is being sold instead of the enchanted item, as well as no nbt enchanted books.

**20w06a**
- Currently the crimson and warped items can be used a fuel within furnaces. This will be changed in future versions, meaning these items will no longer be obtainable in a furnace fuel slot.
- Placing noteblocks on crimson and warped planks sets the noteblock instrument to harp. In later versions this instrument will be base, allowing for discontinued instruments.
- Lava can currently spread soul fire to any flammable block, which is normally not obtainable. This allows for a large variety of discontinued block combinations.
- Soul torches, soul lanterns, and string can all be placed on top of a wall without updating it to a post state, which is normally not obtainable. Placing walls in certain formations also allows for discontinued wall placements. Currently warped and crimson fences do not connect to overworld fences, allowing for discontinued fence configurations.
- Nether sprouts can float, and thus be placed onto any block. This will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Lava can currently be placed on soul soil, and adjacent to blue ice without creating a basalt. This will be an unobtainable block configuration in future versions.

**20w07a**
- Currently, if a piglin enters the overworld, it becomes a zombified piglin. This conversion has a rare chance for the entity to become an adult zombified piglin jockey, which will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Currently piglins and hoglins that are within 16 blocks of a player do not despawn. This allows for persistence required 1b piglins and hoglins without names, which are normally not obtainable.
- Piglins that are holding a crossbow will drop their crossbow to pick up golden items. Normally a piglin needs to be holding a weapon, thus allowing for discontinued piglin variants.
- Baby piglins can currently pick up both soul torches and soul lanterns, however piglins are supposed to be afraid of soul items. In future versions, baby piglins will not be able to pick up soul items.
- Baby piglins can currently pick up leather, and in future versions baby piglins will also no longer be allowed to pick up leather.

**20w09a**
- Crimson and warped signs are now obtainable through crafting. These signs can be placed within the fuel slot of furnaces, which will not be possible in future versions.
- Crying obsidian is currently pushable by pistons. By pushing crying obsidian into the world border, a block 36 of crying obsidian can be created, which will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Moving a powered target using a piston will cause that target to permanently keep it's signal strength. The signal strength will remain even after the projectile is removed

**20w10a**
- Added Crimson and Warped Stripped and Regular Hyphae Blocks, which are obtainable through crafting. These blocks can be used as furnace fuel, which will not be obtainable in future versions.
- If a creeper is duplicated, and then one duplicate is stored and another is exploded adjacent to a fireball, the owner of the fireball will change to be that of the creeper. The fireball can be made stationary by pushing it with a piston into a cobweb in order to preserve it.
- Walls do not connect to Soul Sand in this version

**20w11a**
- Enchanting boots with soul speed and running on soul soil will cause durability to decrease on the boots. There is no check, allowing for negative durability boots, which are normally not obtainable.
- Currently, there is a chance that bartering with a piglin will give the player an enchanted book that is enchanted with soul speed. This enchantment tag is not actually a stored enchantment tag, and is instead applied to the enchanted book as if it was a piece of equipment. This is normally not obtainable.
- Currently soul sand can be ignited with regular fire, which will not be obtainable in future versions

**20w12a**
- Polished basalt can currently be obtained by smelting normal basalt. This allows for polished basalt in the output slot of a furnace. This will later be changed, no longer allowing for polished basalt in the output slot of a furnace.
- Smelting polished basalt in a furnace will add the recipe "minecraft:polished_basalt" to the stored recipes, which will not be a valid furnace recipe in future versions. This stored recipe is completely unobservable, and will be removed if an item is ever taken out of the furnace output slot manually, however hoppers can be used to remove items from the output slot and stack multiple recipes.

**20w13a**
- Currently there is a chance striders will spawn with NoGravity:1b, meaning they float. These striders will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Striders can spawn on top of other striders. Currently there is no upper bound, allowing for 4+ strider stacks, which will be unobtainable in future versions.
- Striders can currently spawn with zombified piglins holding golden swords. This will be changed in future versions so the zombified piglins only hold warped fungi on a stick.
- Right-clicking a compass on a lodestone will change it to lodestone compass without the LodestoneTracked Tag

**20w14∞**
> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- In several dimensions, including the "~N" dimension, player heads generate, which are normally not obtainable.  They can then be mined, drop as items, and thus be brought to the overworld.
- In certain biomes in certain dimensions, zombie horses can spawn as passive mobs. A specific example is the biome "_generated:1913198024" in dimension "zz" around 381, -411. In this location, the area would have to have a sufficient light level and have grass blocks for spawning. Zombie horses can then spawn, as well as baby zombie horses, which can both then be brought to the overworld. Baby zombie horses can also be put into a boat, and then grown up and become an oversized mob in a boat.
- In several dimensions, including the "aaaaaaaaaaaaa" dimension, giants spawn. These giants can be pushed into a large nether portal or into an end portal, and thus be brought into the overworld. Giants are normally not obtainable in the world. there are also left hand variants of Giants that spawn.
- In several dimensions, including the "a" dimension, illusioners spawn, which are normally not obtainable. These illusioners can also be pillager captains. The illusioners can be brought through a nether portal back to the overworld.
- In the "missing" dimension, two iron golems spawn that are missing AI. These iron golems can be pushed into a nether portal, allowing for noAI iron golems in the overworld.
- Within the fleet dimensions, end city ships generate. These ships contain written books instead of elytra. These written books have an unobtainable author name, being "§kDeepest Lore", which causes the written book to have an obfuscated author. These books also contain obfuscated text.
- By clicking on an infinite box of books, a written book pops out. This book will have the unobtainable author name of "§kUniverse itself", and thus will be obfuscated. The title of the book will be based off the coordinates of the infinite box of books, and will contain random text inside.
- In the "llama" dimension, there is a book within a hidden chest written by "Developer". This book is unobtainable in the world unless your username is Developer.
- In certain biomes in certain dimensions, skeleton horses can spawn as passive mobs. A specific example is the biome "_generated:773938501" in dimension "q3" around 1357, -1126. In this location, the area would have to have a sufficient light level and have grass blocks for spawning. Skeleton horses can then spawn, which can then be brought to the overworld. This allows for wild skeleton horses, as well as baby skeleton horses. The baby skeleton horses can also be put in boats, allowing for skeleton horses in a boat.
- In several dimensions, including the "5466788" dimension, wandering traders spawn. These wandering traders will not have a despawn timer, which allows for a variant of wandering trader that is normally not obtainable. Note that the wandering traders will be invisible, so it will be difficult to find them within the dimension. In order to keep these traders, they can be sent through a nether portal back into the overworld.
- In the "llama" dimension, there are llamas that generate which have lime carpets. These llamas are not tamed. Normally, untamed llamas wearing carpets are unobtainable.
- In the "isolation" dimension, there are three dogs that spawn, which have the owner set as the villager Bob. These dogs therefore have an invalid owner. These dogs can also have their collar dyed, which will be unobtainable for dogs with improper owners in future versions.
- Giants, illusioners, and zombie horses are all normally unobtainable mobs obtainable in this version. These mobs can all be killed by the player, and illusioners can kill the player, allowing for a variety of discontinued statistics.
- In several dimensions, including the "~N" dimension, structure voids generate. These structure voids can be mined, and will increase the structure void mined statistic. This statistic is normally not obtainable.
- Maps made in other dimensions will have be of an invalid dimension upon updating. This also occurs for explorer maps, including woodland mansion maps, ocean monument maps, and treasure maps. Therefore, there can also be villagers selling invalid dimension explorer maps.
- Placing a lodestone in one of the new dimensions and clicking it with a compass will create a compass attached to that dimension. These invalid dimension lodestone compasses will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Each dimension has it's own DIM folder, all of which are normally unobtainable. This allows for theoretically over 2 billion discontinued folders.
- Currently, a level.dat and level.dat_old file generate, however they have the name special_level.dat and special_level.dat_old. These are both normally unobtainable files.
- Added the /debugdim command. This command can be used in survival, and creates debug files for whichever dimension you are in. This allows for a large assortment of discontinued files within the world save.

**20w14a - 20w13b (Downgrading)**
- By downgrading a warped fungus on a stick from the previous version, negative durability warped fungus on a stick can be created. This works by taking at least two warped fungi on a stick in the previous version, and getting the durability lower than roughly 70 at least. The lower the durability, the easier to combine. Once these low durability warped fungi on a stick are obtained, they can be downgraded to this version and combined in a crafting table. This will make the warped fungus on a stick receive a lower durability, and can consistently be combined to as low as roughly -2 billion durability. Anything lower than roughly -125 durability will remain negative when updated.

**20w15a**
- Piglins now avoid soul campfires, however baby piglins can still pick up soul campfires. These baby piglins holding soul campfires will not be obtainable in future versions.

**20w16a**
- Currently specific bastion structures generate with a single barrier block. Barrier blocks are normally not obtainable.
- Piglins and hoglins that generate in bastions have a speed level much higher than normally obtainable

**20w17a**
- Piglins that are holding a crossbow will drop their crossbow to pick up golden items. Normally a piglin needs to be holding a weapon, thus allowing for discontinued piglin variants.

**20w21a**
- Currently, piglins can ride any mob that is inside a boat. This therefore allows for many variants of normally unobtainable piglin jockeys. Having a piglin ride one of these mobs in the overworld or end and storing them in unloaded chunks until later can allow for zombified piglins riding many mobs in the future.
- From 20w21a (1.16 snapshot) to 21w44a (1.18 snapshot), there existed a Caves world type, which generated a world strictly composed of caves. To obtain the caves world type, you must set the world type to "Caves" in the world creation menu. Alternatively, you can perform **world save insertion** for any new chunks to generate as the caves world type.

**1.16-Prerelease 6**
- Piglins can now spawn wearing enchanted golden armor, holding enchanted golden swords, and holding enchanted crossbows. Each bastion remnant visited with the world open, adds another layer of enchantments to the equipment held and worn by piglins in bastions. This allows for a wide variety of discontinued enchantment configurations, including conflicting and duplicate enchantments. Duplicate enchantments will be deleted in future versions, but the conflicting enchantments will be preserved.

**20w27a**
- Added Piglin Brutes, which spawn in bastions. Using a dispenser, piglin brutes can be equipped with armor, which will not be allowed in future versions.

**1.16.2-Prerelease 1**
- Zombie villagers can be converted to regular villagers while riding a chicken. They will then not dismount the chicken, allowing for a villager riding a chicken, which is not normally obtainable. The villager can be rezombified, also allowing for adult zombie villagers riding chickens. This same change also allows for piglins riding any mobs to zombify, and thus allows for zombified piglins riding any mob on a boat from earlier versions.

**Combat Test 7a**
- Potions stack to 16, allowing for all potion varieties to be overstacked

**1.16.3 Release Candidate 1**
- Updating overstacked potions from the previous combat test versions allows you to combine the stacks of 16 into larger stacks, allowing for all potions stacked to 64

**20w45a**
- In 20w45a (a 1.17 snapshot), it was possible create overstacked bundles. To create stacked bundles, place at least 2 bundles into a bundle. At most 16 empty bundles can fit into a bundle. Fill every slot in the player's inventory with at least one item, such that every slot of the main inventory is not empty, and attempt to empty the bundle. The bundles that fall onto the ground will be overstacked. They can then be picked up. Overstacked bundles may be combined together with identical overstacked bundles to increase the stack size further.
- Using bundles within the crafting interface allows for certain items to be overstacked. The method requires putting stacked items into a crafting recipe, and then using a bundle to remove one of the ingredients. This doesn't update the output, so taking the output increases the stack size of all remaining ingredients in the crafting grid. This allows for overstacked honey bottles, and overstacked banners and shields.
- Currently 64 bee nests can be placed inside a bundle regardless of nbt data. In future versions, bee nests with nbt data related to bees will only be able to stack to 1 in a bundle, allowing for overstacked bee nests in bundles.
- Using a firecharge from a dispenser, waterlogged candles can be lit
- Added Amethyst Geodes, which generate in a globe shape consisting of amethyst blocks, usually buried in the ground. Currently, geodes can generate higher than Y 30, however this will be changed in future versions. This makes any budding amethyst blocks above Y 30 currently unobtainable.
- Smelting Copper Ore will add the recipe tag of "minecraft:copper_ingot" on a furnace, and a recipe tag of "minecraft:copper_ingot_from_blasting" on a blast furnace, both of which will be changed in future versions. This stored recipe is completely unobservable, and will be removed if an item is ever taken out of the furnace/blast furnace output slot manually, however hoppers can be used to remove items from the output slot and stack multiple recipes.
- If you move a lightning rod with a piston while it is being struck by lightning, it will cause that lightning rod to be permanently powered.

**20w48a**
- By emptying a bundle in the inventory, an empty item tag is created. This empty tag is normally not obtainable.

**21w03a**
- Placing glow lichen into lava in the nether causes it to waterlog, allowing for water in the nether

**21w05a**
- Freezing a Skeleton On a Skeleton Horse or a spider will cause the skeleton to convert to a stray allowing for a Stray Skeleton Horsemen and a Stray Spider Jockey

**21w13a**
- In 21w13a, any new chunks that are loaded will generate the terrain at an abnormal height, at both the central island and the outer islands. This change does not affect the placement of the end spikes (obsidian pillars) or end gateways and as such, those features can generate within the terrain, becoming buried. However, this does affect the placement of the end exit portal and end cities and as such, those features will generate above the terrain, resulting in many end cities being cut off.

**21w15a**
- Any entity that receives the glowing effect through either a spectral arrow or from a creeper explosion lingering cloud of glowing will become permanately glowing and the glowing tag will be set to 1b.
- Salmon buckets now store salmon health. This creates another variant of salmon buckets without size information saved, which will be discontinued in future versions.
- Currently, zombie variants can hold glow ink sacs. This will not be possible in future versions, allowing for several discontinued zombie varieties.
- Beds can be placed towards the world border and half of the bed will be placed outside the world border
- Dragon eggs could teleport beyond the world border when right-clicked near the border.

**21w16a**
- Endermen can currently pick up both azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves. Endermen holding azalea leaves will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves can be used to craft suspicious stew with no effect. This will not be obtainable in future versions.

**21w19a**
- Any bundles with multiple bee nests with nbt will now become bundles with too many items. By right clicking on these bundles with any item, the item can be overstacked and duplicated, allowing for every item in the game to be overstacked in this version.
- By overstacking items inside the bundle, items can be left clicked onto the bundle, and it creates item slots with air and a negative count, however it does also copy the nbt creating bundles full of nbt. Using these nbt bundles with large amounts of nbt data, for example chunk savestating books, can be used to overfill a chunk and perform both chunk savestating and chunk regeneration, which will be further utilized in later versions.
- Obtaining a large bundle and attempting to save, and crashing the game at a precise time during this save can create a level#############.dat file, which is a file discontinued feature will not be obtainable in future versions. Similarly, by performing this crash while attempting to save a chunk containing more data than allocated ram, a tmp###################.tmp can be created in the region folder, which is another file discontinued feature that will not be obtainable in future versions.

**1.17.1 - 21w05a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Deepslate, Chiseled Deepslate, Polished Deepslate, Deepslate Tiles, Cracked Deepslate Tiles, Deepslate Bricks, Cracked Deepslate Bricks, Cobbled Deepslate, Deepslate Lapis Lazuli Ore, Deepslate Redstone Ore, Deepslate Diamond Ore, Deepslate Emerald Ore, Deepslate Gold Ore, Deepslate Iron Ore, Deepslate Copper Ore, Deepslate Coal Ore, Infested Deepslate, Smooth Basalt, Waxed Variants for Oxidized Copper Variants, Raw Iron, Raw Copper, Raw Gold, Raw Iron Blocks, Raw Copper Blocks, Raw Gold Blocks, and any Deepslate Variants of Walls, Stairs, or Slabs will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items.

**21w05a - 21w03a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing  Azaleas, Azalea Leaves, Flowering Azalea Leaves, Cave Vines, Glowberries, Big Dripleaf, Small Dripleaf, Hanging Roots, Moss Blocks, Moss Carpets, and Rooted Dirt will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (192 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**21w03a - 20w51a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Glow Lichen, Glow Ink Sacs, and Glow Item Frames will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (256 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w51a - 20w48a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Bucket of Axolotl will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the item will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include this item.

**20w48a - 20w46a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Dripstone Blocks and Pointed Dripstone will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (384 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w45a (Datapack)**
> [!Note]
> This version requires a Caves & Cliffs Datapack. The 21w15a Caves & Cliffs Datapack can be downloaded from the "Mods & Extra Files" folder. From here, the zip folder can directly be placed into the datapacks folder within the world save folder.
- Downgrading bundles containing a Powdered Snow Bucket will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the item will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include this item. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (448 if stacked with the previous bundle). It is recommended to combine this with 64 unique bee nests within the bundle for the maximum bundle size.

**21w03a**
- In 21w03a, Shulkers were changed such that when they entered a minecart, they would immediately reorient themselves right-side up and parallel to the block grid, meaning that any shulkers put in minecarts before then will keep their previous orientations but not display them when upgraded. the rotation is not limited to just the 6 normal rotations an attached shulker can have, but is very free as shulkers before 21w03a would rotate to follow the facing direction of a minecart they are in, which would be kept on updating.

**21w05b (Datapack)**
> [!Note]
> This version requires the same Caves & Cliffs Datapack from the previous version, meaning no file editing is required if updating from the previous version
- The world height is now increased to 320, and extends below to -64. Any new chunks generated in this version with the datapack will have solid stone generate underneath all chunks extending down from Y0 to Y-64, with no bedrock.

**1.18-Exp 1**
> [!Note]
> This version does not use a datapack and requires world save insertion to use. First, the datapack can be removed from the world save, and then the world save can be removed from the saves folder. From here, go to the create a world screen and set the name to the name of the world save folder. Then drag the world save back into the saves folder, and select create world. This will force load the world in this version.
- All biomes are now height dependent. This allows for the same X and Z location to have a different biome on Y level. This is also the case in future versions, however currently the generation of these Y level biomes continue past normal biome boundaries, allowing for invalid biome variants dependent on Y level.

**1.18-Exp 2**
> [!Note]
> This version does not use a datapack and requires world save insertion to use. First, the datapack can be removed from the world save, and then the world save can be removed from the saves folder. From here, go to the create a world screen and set the name to the name of the world save folder. Then drag the world save back into the saves folder, and select create world. This will force load the world in this version.
- Added a CustomeSpawnRules tag to spawners, which determines the light level of which mobs can spawn. Currently, all old spawners have the value set to 0, which is not obtainable normally. Updating these spawners to later versions converts them to pig spawners, which are not normally obtainable.

**1.18-Exp 7**
- Elytra no longer take damage when gliding. Elytra take exactly three damage each time a firework rocket is used. Elytra can now break when reaching 0 durability. This allows for the elytra broken statistic to increase. This statistic can not normally increase, due to elytra never breaking.

**21w39a - 21w37a (Downgrading)**
- Currently washing a banner in a cauldron cause it to retain the id tag while losing all of the patterns, creating a blank banner with an unnecessary nbt tag. By placing and breaking this banner it will change the tag to be an empty pattern tag. These are two variants of banners that will be discontinued in future versions.

**1.19-Exp 1**
> [!Note]]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Added the swift sneak enchantment, which currently can be applied to boots. This enchantment will be a leggings exclusive enchantment in future versions, making swift sneak enchanted boots unobtainable.
- Reinforced Deepslate can currently be pushed by pistons, allowing for reinforced deepslate in any position in the overworld and allowing it be stored in block 36 form, both of which will be discontinued when the block is recontinued.

**22w13oneBlockAtATime**
- The ender dragon can be brought into the overworld by flying it below Y-32 in the end
- Various items can be obtained in this version that are not normally obtainable. Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Petrified Oak Slabs, and End Portal Frames can all be obtained either through an enderman handing them to the player, and then storing them in a donkey or storing them as a falling entity, which is then dropped onto a torch in the following version. Storing them as an item will maintain the blockstate tag, whereas storing them as an entity will drop them without any nbt data. End portal frames also generate naturally in nether fortress loot table chests.
- Endermen can also spawn holding "generic_item_block"s, allowing for every item not normally obtainable, including spawn eggs, debug stick, knowledge book, and command block minecart
- Endermen spawn in holding any random block with varying blockstates, allowing for hundreds of discontinued endermen variations. Endermen can also spawn holding blocks that lack item forms, for example air variants and bubble columns.
- End Gateways can be obtained in both the nether and end, as enderman can spawn holding these blocks, and the player can pick up these blocks and place them in other dimensions. Similarly, nether portals can be obtained in the end through this same method.
- Every arrangement of an invalid blockstate is theoretically obtainable, as endermen can spawn with blocks with any blockstate, which can then be placed. Several examples are only possible through this method, such as waterlogged soul campfires, all direction false vines, and waterlogged double slabs.
- All Entities can be stacked, allowing for numerous variations of stacked entities and entities in boats
- Blocks can be placed directly into a minecart allowing for minecarts with custom display states. There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game. Placing a normal item into a minecart will convert into a minecart with the custom display state of air.
- The ender dragon can be ridden, allowing for a player on top of dragon jockey setup
- Any mob except for ender dragons can wear carved pumpkins or barrels in the helmet slot by throwing carved pumpkins or barrels onto the head of the entity.

- Any block can be converted to a falling entity by using a dropper, or by throwing a block. These can be stored by dropping them onto block 36.  There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game.
- Picking up blocks allows for items with the blockstate tag. Blocks that do not normally store a blockstate will have an empty blockstate tag, and all blocks that normally have a blockstate can have numerous blockstate tags. Certain blockstate tags, such as "waterlogged:true" can only be obtained when handed to the player by an enderman, which can occur by angering an enderman and letting it hit the player.
- Water in the nether can be obtained either through placing a block with a waterlogged blockstate, or by throwing blocks such as seagrass in the nether.
- End crystal entities can be placed above and below the build limits by picking up end crystal entities and dropping them in the air at these points
- Droppers and dispensers do not have block entities in this version, allowing them to be pushed by pistons and allowing for droppers and dispensers to be stored in block 36 form
- Currently throwing or placing any block increases the use statistic. This allows for the use statistic to increase for several items that normally cannot be placed in survival. This includes structure blocks, jigsaws, command blocks, repeating command blocks, and chain command blocks.
- Currently throwing or placing any item increases the use statistic. This allows for the use statistic to increase for several items that normally cannot be used in survival. This includes items such as diamonds and heart of the sea.
- When updating into this version while wearing an elytra, it will break when attempting to fly, allowing for the broken elytra statistic to increase
- In 22w13oneBlockAtATime villagers have new trades including trading for blocks and entities, loading these trades outside of this snapshot turns them into air trades. This can be circumvented by updating a zombie villager with the trades instead of a villager. Curing or updating to 24w09a or later deletes the trades.

**22w14a**
- Allays can have armor dispensed onto them after being given an item, allowing for armored allays, which will likely be discontinued in future versions. This also allows for the killed by allay statistic by having another player equip them with thorns armor, which will likely be future discontinued.
- Allays spawned in this version will have a higher generic movement speed than allays in newer versions
- Added Recovery Compasses, which point to the location where the player last died. Currently, by having exactly two recovery compasses in a stack, and clicking both of them on a lodestone, one will become a recovery compass with lodestone tags, which will be discontinued in the next version.
- Recovery compasses can be used on a lodestone, which increases the recovery compass used statistic, which will be discontinued in future versions
- You can enchant Recovery Compasses wuth Curse of Vanishing
- Currently growing a mangrove tree doesn't update blocks around it, allowing for many discontinued mangrove tree arrangements, such as a mangrove root on snowy grass

**22w17a**
- The player receives a new uuid in this version, allowing for pets to have an invalid owner id, and for multiple statistic and advancement files

**22w24a**

**22w42a**
- You can place a Hanging Sign on the bottom of a fence gate

**22w43a**
- Placing a birch wall sign on the side of a block and placing a note block above it sets the note block instrument to snare. In future versions this instrument will be bass, making this a discontinued note block variant.
- Dropping an anvil onto a fireball and then having it land inside a moving piston, it will create a fireball that has that anvil as the owner. This fireball can be made stationary by pushing it with a piston into a cobweb to preserve it.

**22w44a**
- Spawner minecarts will now be one of two varieties depending on the update path taken. For an empty spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in 13w06a through 15w31d, then kept unloaded until 1.11, then kept unloaded again until this version. For a pig spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in one of the versions of 1.13 or later. This snapshot technically creates a discontinued feature as a result of this split of spawner minecarts.
- Mobs with canpickuploot can wear armor, however they now will also pick up armor, even if it replaces a weapon. Normally a weapon takes precedence over armor for held items, meaning mobs that always spawn holding a weapon holding armor instead are discontinued. The discontinued mob variants holding armor are skeletons, strays, wither skeletons, piglins, and zombified piglins.
- Placing down a Spawner in this version to the present will cause it to be an empty spawner

**22w45a**
- Currently trying to place a book into a full chiseled bookshelf duplicates the book and increases the stack size. This allows for overstacked enchanted books, book and quills, and written books, and is the first overstacking method for any enchanted book with swift sneak

**22w46a**
- Added new noteblock instruments in the form of mob sounds. By placing a mob head on a noteblock, the note block will now play the corresponding sound of the mob. This introduces discontinued noteblocks, as any noteblocks with mob heads on them from earlier versions will have the incorrect instrument.

**1.19.3-Prerelease 1**
- Tropical fish can spawn with the color black as both a base color and highlight color. Fish with black coloring are not supposed to spawn naturally, making these discontinued tropical fish variants.
- Added a "custom_head" instrument for player heads placed on noteblocks. There is currently not a sound associated with the head. Any player heads placed on noteblocks in earlier versions will have an incorrect instrument, thus creating a discontinued feature.

**23w05a**
- Potion effects can now be made infinite when the potion effect is set to a duration of -1. These infinite effects should normally be unobtainable, however by layering a lower level longer duration potion with the equivalent higher level shorter duration potion in a specific order, an infinite effect can be created. Since 1.15.2 Pre-Release 1, when a higher level status effect is applied over a lower level with the lower level having a higher duration, the lower level will be retained. The lower level will continue to decrease its duration as the higher level effect's duration decreases. However, if the higher level status effect is applied again with a duration longer than the lower level, the lower level will have a duration lower than the higher level. Before this snapshot, the duration would stop decreasing at 0, but as -1 was added as a valid duration in this snapshot, it will tick down once more to -1. When the higher level status effect ends, the infinite effect will be applied.

**23w06a**
- Jack O' Lanterns can be placed on armor stands, which will not be allowed in future versions, and also picked up and worn by canpickuploot mobs. While mobs can wear Jack O' Lanterns on Halloween, these Jack O' Lanterns cannot have any custom nbt, such as curses or names, allowing for discontinued entity variants.

**23w07a**
- Suspicious sand is not supposed to be obtainable as an item. However, by dropping it into a bubble column, cobwebs, or the end portal, it still drops.
- Crafting decorated pots creates a shard list tag. In future versions this will be a sherd list tag, however updating these will maintain the shard tag creating discontinued pot variants. This tag is not visible.
- Placing decorated pots in water waterlogs them, however it does not properly update water, allowing for discontinued waterlogged decorated pot configurations.

**23w12a**
- Suspicious gravel is not supposed to be obtainable as an item. However, by dropping it into a bubble column, cobwebs, or the end portal, it still drops.

- Pitcher crops can be planted on farmland, and will float when breaking the farmland below them. Floating pitcher pods are a discontinued block configuration.

**23w13a_or_b**
- The votes to replace any inventory item and replace any crafting output preserves the nbt of the item and transfers it to the new item. Pairing this with the nbt crafting allows for any nbt on any item, technically also allowing for any item through the use of container inventory. This works by getting a replace item to replace a compound tag with a container of some sort, which is incredibly rare when multiplying these odds together. This by extension also allows for no nbt on items that normally would have nbt, such as suspicious stews. https://mcdf.wiki.gg/wiki/Java_Edition:Any_NBT_on_Any_Item 
- Added votes that replace any inventory item, any crafting output, or any loot drop with a random item.

- Dupe hack items can be crafted with any other item in the crafting table to duplicate the item. This allows for a stack of 2 of any item crafted with the dupe hack, which can then be combined further into larger stacks. This allows for every item to be overstacked to 64.
- Using the replace item in inventory vote to replace a stacked item with an unstackable item creates an overstacked item
- Added a vote to give a random entity a percent chance of dropping their respective spawn egg. This allows for every spawn egg to be obtained.

This can be repeated indefinitely every time a stack size vote appears. Note that attempting to place items in a bundle while their stack size is set at above 64 will crash the game
- Added a vote that changes the emerald in villager trades to a random item. These trades can be stacked on top of normal villager trades, allowing for an insane amount of discontinued villager combinations. Updating trades of items added in this version also allows for air trades as they get deleted in future versions. Note these air trades also get removed in future versions.
- Drinking a bottle of void while having any potion effect duplicates the effect onto a potion under custom potion effects. This allows for numerous discontinued potion variants, including discontinued levels and durations, even allowing for infinite potion effects potions. Having players from older versions with invalid potion effects who rejoin while maintaining that potion effect in this version also allows these old potion effects to be preserved.
- The perma_effect vote allows all players to receive the bad luck effect, luck and anymother effect with an amplifier between I (1) and VI (6) for an infinite amount of time. This can be combined with the Bottle of Void item (unique to this version) to turn these effects into potions, these potions can then be updated out of 23w13a_or_b and be used to apply the effect for an infinite amount of time
- Voting for midas touch and then touching mobs will turn them into gold. This turns the mob noAI and silent and applies for every mob (except sniffers because they crash).

- Added a vote called the midas touch. This will convert every item in the player's inventory into golden equivalents, allowing for any nbt tag on golden ingots when paired with nbt crafting, as well as any normal nbt on various golden items. This also allows for negative durability on every piece of golden armor and tools by lowering the durability of any tool and then converting it to gold
- The replace crafting output vote allows for any item to replace the output of a furnace recipe. This allows for any item in the output slots of furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces.
- The potion of big is brewed from bottles of experience, and potions of small are brewed from rabbit hides. These items are not normally allowed in a brewing stand, creating two variants of discontinued items in brewing stands.
- Using a potion of big or small on a mob, and keeping the mob in unloaded chunks until 23w51a will allow the mob to retain the invalid generic.scale attribute, allowing for numerous variants of incorrectly sized mobs.
- Mining the dropper or chest from the lunar base drops the respective item with a custom translation string. Similarly, using a piston to break any of the shulker boxes generated in the lunar structure drops shulker boxes with custom translation strings and loot tables.
- The vote to replace villager trades also allows for usually discontinued no nbt items, including blank enchanted books, empty written books, no nbt suspicious stew and bee nests
- The votes that give a player a random item or allow a chicken to lay a random item instead of an egg will also give the player no nbt items. This allows for blank enchanted books, empty written books, no nbt suspicious stew and bee nests, and uncraftable potion variants, among other things.

- Added vote rules to change the generated block from water touching lava or lava touching blue ice to a random block. This allows for numerous discontinued block configurations as any block can generate in a position where water touches lava or lava touches blue ice.
- Added a vote rule that enables pistons to push block entities. This allows for several variants of block 36 with invalid block data by pushing blocks such as chests into the world border.
- Added the Button on Things vote rule, which allows for buttons, levers, pressure plates, repeaters, comparators, redstone dust, bells, and grindstones to be placed on various blocks that they are not normally allowed to be placed on, such as anvils and fence posts. This allows for many discontinued block configurations.
- Utilizing movable block entities allows can summon shriekers to be moved into invalid locations
- Dupe hack items can be crafted with any other item in the crafting interface to duplicate the item. This allows for crafting outputs of any item, and thus crafting statistics for every single item, even items not normally craftable.

- Using a moon cow spawn egg on a spawner creates a spawner with moon cow entity data, which is not normally obtainable
- Using a map on the moon creates a map with dimension data of the moon, which is not normally obtainable
- Using the new thing banner pattern creates a banner with a future discontinued banner pattern Getting the replace loot drop vote to replace tipped arrows with an item would allow for slowness potion effects on any item through killing strays. Getting it to replace certain block entities will also allow for discontinued items with block entity tags .
- The dream mode vote allows for treasure and higher level enchantments from an enchantment table. This allows for treasure enchantments on items without repair cost, which depending on the material used is not normally obtainable (such as turtle shells).
- Added vote rules to create backwards diamond swords and bows. These crafting recipes craft the respective item, but with an nbt tag of "wob:1b". This is a discontinued nbt tag.

- Added a vote rule to change saplings to require an adjacent liquid to grow, or turn into dead bushes. This also prevents liquids from breaking saplings, allowing for discontinued sapling configurations.
- Votes are stored in the world file in a vote.json file, as well as generating a backup file of vote.json_old. Both of these are discontinued world files.
- The moon dimension generates in a dimensions folder. The dimensions folder does not normally generate in the world folder, allowing for several discontinued folders and files.

**23w42a**
> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version with update 1.21 experimental features enabled, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Bundle datapack. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Crafters will currently output stacked written books into chiseled bookshelves when copying written books and stacked glass bottles into brewing stands when crafting glass bottles. These slots normally do not allow stacked items, making this a discontinued block configuration.

- Trial chambers can currently generate in the deep dark biome, which will not happen in future versions
- Trial spawners will have simultaneous mobs added and loot distribution weights changed in future versions, making all trial spawners that generate in this version discontinued variants

**23w51a**
- Crafting suspicious stews with a dandelion or a blue orchid creates a 7 second stew instead of a 7 tick stew, which are unobtainable variants. This also works to create discontinued mooshroom variants by feeding them the respective flowers.

**24w03a**
- Currently Sharpness/Smite/Bane of Arthropods can apply to axes and thorns can apply to non chestplate armor in the enchantment table, allowing for these items to have these enchantments without repair cost. Normally these enchantments on these respective items are only obtainable through an anvil, and thus will have repair cost.

**24w05a**
- Updating horses wearing horse armor into this version causes the armor to be duplicated, and also remain within the ArmorItems tag. Normally horses cannot have anything equipped in these slots.

**24w07a**
- The trial spawners that used to spawn skeletons holding poison arrows now spawn bogged, discontinuing the older variant of trial spawners. These trial spawners for bogged will have their simultaneous mobs added and loot distribution changed in future versions, making these a new discontinued variant of trial spawner themselves.

**24w09a**
- Currently any chunks with overstacked items can be savestated, as attempting to save invalid item counts of items (or bundles with invalid items inside of them) causes the chunk to revert to it's last save. This allows for item and block duplication, and many discontinued block configurations.
- Grindstoning enchanted books adds the Damage:0 tag to the book, which is an invalid nbt tag.
- Updating old cleric villagers from 13w36a that have the empty enchantment trades will remove this tag, instead causing these villagers to become a variant of cleric selling completely unenchanted armor. This is a distinctly different variant of discontinued villager trade, as in future versions this tag will instead be converted to enchantment_glint_override.
- All overstacked items have been reverted until 1.20.5 Prerelease 1 which means if you want to keepnall of your overstacked items, they must be kept in unloaded chunks

**24w10a**
- By placing two of the same items into the grindstone slots, the enchantments of the item in the bottom slot will be transferred to the item in the top slot. This only works for items that have durability, however it allows for all enchantments to be combined on a single item without repair cost, and many instances of incompatible enchantment combinations.
- Loading bee nest or beehive items with honey levels from 24w07a or before will convert the honey level tag to true or false instead of remaining a number. Since this value is supposed to be a number, this is a discontinued tag, and is also completely unobservable.

All these recipes will be removed in future versions, and these recipes can be stacked on top of other recipes utilizing hoppers to transfer items.
- Mobs spawned during the mega spud boss battle all have persistence required:1b. This allows for chickens, armadillos, creepers, ghasts, and giants to all generate with persistence_required:1b, all of which are discontinued variants of these mobs.
- The spiders spawned during the mega spud boss battle can be skeleton jockeys, allowing for spider jockeys to be in the end after teleporting the mega spud to the end. Normally jockeys cannot travel through portals, meaning these are mobs in an invalid dimension.

> [!Note]
> In order to get librarians trading the new enchanted books, the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack has to be disabled, and to load this world out of the april fools version, both of which can be performed through world save insertion. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21 and the Bundle datapack, and then toggle the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack to off.

- In the dimensions/minecraft folder of your world, new level# (with # replaced by the level number) folders can be created in 25w14craftmine. There is no way to reach these dimensions after 25w14craftmine, making this a file discontinued feature.
- In the data folder of your world, a new mine_data.dat file is created in 25w14craftmine that remains after updating out of the version
- For each level created in 25w14craftmine, a datapack will be created to specify that level's dimension properties. They will remain after WSI, but will not properly register their dimensions due to using minecraft:generated as the type field, which is not a registered type by default
- The memory lane extends all the way past the world border. Downgrading from the April Fools' snapshot results in a hallway of stone and gray stained glass being past the world border around -30000000, 0, 8. Other chunks past the world border will be full of air.
- After unlocking the 'Varangian' unlock, entering a mine gives the player a netherite axe with Sharpness V and Looting III. Looting is normally not obtainable on axes and sharpness is normally only obtainable via anvils, which add repair cost.
- After unlocking the 'Dirt Connoisseur' unlock any dirt making its way into the player's inventory will turn it consumable including Coarse Dirt, Grass Block, Moss Block, Mud, Muddy Mangrove Roots, Mycelium, Pale Moss Block, Podzol and Rooted Dirt.
- In the April Fools snapshot 25w14craftmine, you can get some mobs with permanent glowing effect: Endermen, Silverfish, Baby Zombie, Skeleton, Wither Skeleton, Baby Drowned, and Vexes. To get them out of the snapshot, you and the mob will have to get on the coordinates 0, 0 in a boat and do WSI (World Save Insertion). Upon entering the world you'll spawn at coordinates 0, 0 in the Overworld. If you don't follow the coordinates you may fall into the void.
- In the Warden special event 32 villagers with NoAI: 1b, Invulnerable: 1b and Silent: 1b spawn as part of the audience. They can be turned into witches, which will result in NoAI, invulnerable, and silent Witches
- When loading into a raid special event the player is given bad omen with a duration of -1. It normally turns into raid omen right away due to the player always (at least in my testing) spawning inside a village, this can be avoided by quickly logging out and downgrading from this version. The bad omen will also show particles, which bad omen typically does not.
- Baby zombies spawned during "Small but Deadly" mine, will always drop their helmets upon death. Those that have CanPickUpLoot:0b - are discontinued, as that behavior cannot be recreated in normal gameplay.
- In 25w14craftmine placing a lodestone next to an uneployed villager turns them into a traitor, a new profession. Downgrading out of this version deletes their profession (they retain their level) and all trades which include april fools' items. A Traitor's trades are: Novice: 8 Coal for 1 Emerald, Apprentice: 4 Iron Ingots for 1 Emerald, Journeyman: 8 Redstone Dust for 1 Emerald, Expert: 1 Diamond for 1 Emerald. Placing a new job site block next to these villagers makes them change their profession and replaces all their trades with ones from their new profession. The career level however is retained, and the new trades are based on the career level. Meaning that if the traitor was an apprentice the villager will be missing their novice trades and if it was a master the villager will be missing all their trades from expert and below.
- In 25w14craftmine you can get the illusioner to spawn naturally in a mine via having the illusioner mine ingredient in it, but they're pretty rare to spawn
- Several of the unlocks in 25w14craftmine make the player start with an enchanted item. These enchanted items don't have repair cost. During the enchanting process in the enchanting table a singular modified level gets used to find the list of possible enchantments and their levels, which means that there are combinations which cannot be obtained while enchanting (for example you can't get an efficiency 5 fortune 1 pickaxe). Here is a list of enchanted items from unlocks whose enchantment combination is not obtainable from an enchanting table (the levels which allow for the specific enchantment is listed in brackets):
Golden Pickaxe from Silky Pick: Silk Touch (15-65), Unbreaking I (5-12), Diamond Pickaxe from Lucky Pick: Fortune III (33-83), Efficiency IV (31-40), Unbreaking I (5-12), Iron Sword from You call that a knoife?: Sharpness III (23-33), Sweeping Edge I (5-13), Diamond Sword from Shiny Sword: Sharpness III (23-33), Sweeping Edge II (14-22), Looting II (24-32), Netherite Sword from No Nether Needed: Sharpness V (45-65), Sweeping Edge II (14-22), Looting II (24-32) 
- In 25w14craftmine, Any frog can "devoure" you in a mine that has the "Wednesday frog" challenge ingredient, that saves it as a "frog killed you" statistic
- Many of the player unlocks in 25w14craftmine achieve their effects by giving the player an attribute modifier, which are not removed when updating out of this version (unless their attribute exists only in 25w14craftmine).
-  When inside a mine with the One HP mine ingredient the player is given an attribute modifier that reduces max health by 19. The modifier is cleared upon leaving the mine, but it can be preserved by updating out of 25w14craftmine without leaving the mine.
-  Using a mine revisitor to visit an old mine sets the player's game mode to adventure. Dying in a mine in multiplayer sets the player's game mode to spectator. These game modes can be preserved by logging off and updating out of craftmine.

**1.21.8**
- Occasionally inside of a shipwreck an treasure map will spawn inside of the chest but instead of being a normal treasure map it will be an empty treasure map

**25w34a**
- Before 25w35a copper golems that were given poppies by iron golems have them in their head slot instead of the saddle slot
- Explosions reduce acceleration power of nearby projectiles by half, this allows for wind charges with acceleration power of 0.05, 0.025, 0.0125 and so on. Normally wind charges have acceleration of 0, but redirecting them via punching or hitting them with a projectile sets it to 0.1, which can then be halved any number of times. Note that only wind charges with acceleration power other than 0 or 0.1 are discontinued as other projectiles can still have their acceleration power reduced by bouncing them off of a breeze

**25w35a**
-In 25w35a, shelves can connect to other shelves facing the opposite direction, in 25w36b, this connection can no longer happen, making connected shelves facing different directions discontinued, the connection doesn't always happen in 25w35a either, the most reliable way is to place the redstone blocks after the shelves, or re-place them afterwards. 

**25w36a**
- In snapshot 25w36a/b, by placing an unwaxed copper rod of any oxidation level but the default one next to blocks that are able to interact with redstone and having it get struck by lightning will cause the blocks to power forever (as long as no block updates are caused). Exceptions include: repeaters, comparators, pistons and sticky pistons.
