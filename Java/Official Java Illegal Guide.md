- Exploding A Chest while keeping it open will cause the items inside the chest to convert to 0 stack items. These items are useful for duplication, overstacked items, and understacked items. A 0 Stack item is a the most well known duplication method and java illegal, once you have it you can right click in your inventory and it will give you and infinite amount of diamonds. Every time you right click the 0 stack item, the item count will start going into the negatives allowing for negative durability stacked items, and once it reaches -129 it will overlap and the item count will become +127.

**Beta 1.3.2 - Infdev 20100624**
> [!Note]
> In order to access this version, the world save folder will have to be named as World[1-5]. During this downgrade, the level.dat and level.dat_old should be removed temporarily. A world without a level.dat can be accessed by selecting the respective slot when going to the singleplayer screen. The level.dat and level.dat_old will have to be restored when updating back to b1.3-2 in order to preserve the Alpha File Format folders of the next version. No chunks, entities, or placed blocks will be affected during this downgrade.	
- This version has a file format that is not used in any other version. A folder named "data" is used, and contains "entities.dat" and "zones.dat" This folder will become completely unused upon updating out of this version and nothing will be converted to a different file format. This creates several file discontinued features. 

**Beta 1.2_02-launcher**
- This is the last version that uses the Alpha file format. Since the Alpha File Format from the original world has already been converted, updating to this version will regenerate an entirely new world with the Alpha File Format. This allows for numerous folders in both the world save folder and the DIM-1 folder, that are titled with numbers and letters, which contain subfolders titled with numbers and letters, that contain .dat files, since this is how the Alpha File Format worked. There are hundreds of discontinued folders possible. 	

**Beta 1.3.2**

In order to access the world after removing level.dat, you can go to create world and create a world with the same name as the world save. It is also recommended to use the same seed to prevent chunk borders. It is recommended to replace the original level.dat after entering this version in order to preserve the discontinued world name from the previous versions.
- Upon level.dat creation, debug chests would generate at the world spawn and contain every item in the game at the time including illegal items.

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 (MOD)**
> [!Note]
> This version uses a mod to assign a block id to a cauldron in order to access the original brewing system. The beta 1.9 pre2 cauldron mod can be downloaded from resources. The zip file can then be extracted, and the folder titled "enable" can be zipped. This enabled zip can then be added to a b1.9-pre2 instance in multimc by going to edit instance and add to minecraft.jar. You can find this mod in the "Mods & Extra Files" folder
- The cauldron currently uses the id of an enchantment table and the block data of a brewing stand. This means that updating out of this version will convert the cauldron to an enchantment table with the block data of a brewing stand
- Potions can be brewed by adding an assortment of ingredients to a cauldron. A total of 5,339 potion variations are possible using this method, most of which provide discontinued status effects and create invalid data value potions. A potion calculator is included on the resource sheet to explain the brewing process in more detail. 

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3-1**
> [!Note]
> Certain multiplayer exclusive chunks can be obtained, however it requires file manipulation. Regions from a newly generated multiplayer world can be copied into the pre-existing world. This would work by taking a region file, changing the numbers to not conflict with previously existing region files, and adding them to the preexisting world.
- The player would spawn with debug items including a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portals, and end portal frames. Hovering your cursor over the end portals will crash your game due to a missing tooltip

There is no way to obtain these chunks in a pre-existing world, however the region files can be moved from a newly generated multiplayer world to the preexisting world by renumbering the newly generated region files

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4-1**
- Enchanting in this version works normally and all previous enchants would convert to Feather Falling I, however Silk Touch and Fortune are not mutually exclusive allowing for Silk Touch and Fortune on the same tool
- Silk Touch works on Spawners, Infested Stone, Lit Furnaces, Double Slabs, Lit Redstone Ore, and Ice which all become unobtainable in newer versions
- Placing a support block on a glass block will misplace the support block somewhere where it can be placed, using this method you can place support blocks on chests which can give you unobtainable block formations

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6**
- The exit portal would generate when the ender dragon is killed but the exit portal would generate where the dragon died and not at 0,0 allowing for the exit end portal in discontinued locations
- Nether Portal can be placed in the end, allowing for nether portals in the end

**1.0.0 Release Candidate 1**

**12w07a**
- The file format is now Anvil instead of MCRegion. This converts all .mcr files to .mca, however the .mcr files are maintained within the world save folder for all three dimensions. Additionally, a level.dat backup is taken named level.dat_mcr. These are all discontinued files.
- The End in this version does not generate with any main end island it is just you and the void. Additionally when you kill the ender dragon the exit portal will spawn where the dragon died instead of at 0.0

**12w08a**

- A file called EduWorldSettings.ini is generated within the world save. A folder called MCEdu is created within the world save, which includes a file named signLocations_en.ini and a file named tips_en.txt. Within the MCEdu folder a file called infoLocations_en.ini is created when an information block is placed and the game is saved. The teleportLocations_en.ini, teleportLocations.ini, and allowedteleports.ini files are created when a station block is placed and the game is saved. These files and folders are exclusive to Edu versions, and will be discontinued in future versions. 
- Player data is saved in the players folder under username.dat. Additionally, server.log and server.log.lck are created within the world folder. The server log contains the entire chat output. These files are multiplayer exclusive, and will become discontinued in future versions.

**12w15a**
- Shift click works with brewing stands. This allows for overstacked glass bottles in brewing stand.

**12w17a-2**
- Chunk resetting is possible by overloading a chunk with written books. It requires over a chest of books filled with random unicode characters. This allows for an assortment of block discontinued features and item duplication. This will be further utilized in later versions.
- The title for written books is currently 16 characters which later will be updated to 15
- Pressing enter inside a book and quill creates a newline character, but it does not advance the line. This allows for a total of up to 256 newline characters, which is far more than will be allowed in future versions.

**12w21a**
- Villagers now have trades. Every single villager trade will become unobtainable in future versions, whether through invalid prices or invalid items.

**12w37a**
- Wither can explode end portal frames when spawned which results in end portal frame removal.

**12w41a**
- Anvils can rename an item to have no characters and all spaces which will become unobtainable in future versions

- Updating Mobs from this version into future version will allow for unobtainable variants of mobs due to speed change
- Wild Horses can be saddled in this version

**1.6.3-1**
- Bounding boxes now save with the world. In order for current structures (witch huts, nether fortresses, etc.) to be saved to the world file, the player must load the appropriate chunks within the game manually. After this is completed, structures will be compatible in all snapshots starting with snapshot. All these bounding boxes will not be obtainable in their current locations in future versions.
- These bounding boxes are stored in structure files, which are generated when the respective structure is loaded. These files are Village.dat, Fortress.dat, Temple.dat, Mineshaft.dat, and Stronghold.dat. All of these files will be discontinued in a future version.

**1.6.4 Build 1 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- A file called forcedchunks.dat generates within the world save folder, which will become unobtainable in non edu versions

**13w36a-1**
- A method of block transmutation is now possible. This method works by firing an arrow, then pushing the arrow with a piston so it is floating, and then breaking the block it was previously on and replacing it with a golden pressure plate. This allows for several invalid data value blocks, and an easy form of update suppression by creating 6 sided pistons
- Crafting a Carrot on a Stick with a Fishing Rod that is enchanted with Lure and Luck of the Sea allowing for a Carrot on A Stick with Lure and Luck of the Sea enchantments
- Silk Touch and Luck of the Sea can be applied on the same enchanted book
- Currently reloading a villager removes the second buy slot item. This allows for free enchantment trades on clerics and it only costs a book for an enchanted book, as well as gravel to flint conversion for free. These will all be unobtainable trades in future versions.
- Statistics do not track data values. This means that when crafting any color dye, it increases the statistic for ink sacs. The ink sac crafted statistic will be unobtainable in future verions.
- Items and blocks that are normally unobtainable can have various statistics associated with them, allowing for discontinued statistics by extension. Examples include bedrock placed. There is also the special case of command blocks placed. In future versions command blocks will no longer be able to be placed in survival, meaning that the statistic is both discontinued by block type and by statistic value.
- Enchantments are not applied properly either through anvils of enchanting tables, resulting in items with an empty enchantment tag. These items all have a discontinued nbt tag by having no enchantments yet still having the enchantments tag.
- The empty enchantments also apply to villager trades, allowing for cleric villagers to sell enchanted armor without enchantments. This trade will become unobtainable in future versions.

**13w37a**
- Enchanted Books in loot table chests do not have enchantments
- Chunk regeneration can occur by mining a powered redstone lamp with silk touch. This allows for an assortment of unobtainable block configurations.

The locked chest will convert to stained glass in the future if it is kept unloaded until the addition of stained glass.

**13w37b**
- Bounding boxes now save with the world. In order for current structures (witch huts, nether fortresses, etc.) to be saved to the world file, the player must load the appropriate chunks within the game manually. After this is completed, structures will be compatible in all snapshots starting with snapshot. All these bounding boxes will not be obtainable in their current locations in future versions.
- These bounding boxes are stored in structure files, which are generated when the respective structure is loaded. These files are Village.dat, Fortress.dat, Temple.dat, Mineshaft.dat, and Stronghold.dat. All of these files will be discontinued in a future version.

**13w49a**
- Added Chicken Jockeys. Chickens in chicken jockeys currently lay eggs, as the "IsJockey" tag does not exist yet. Chickens also maintain agression against the player after the zombie is dead, despite not being able to deal damage.

**1.7.10 Build 1 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- Player data is saved in the playerdata folder under username.dat. This will become unobtainable in future versions as it is stored as a UUID instead of a username. Additionally, since you are logging in in offline mode, the UUID for the statistics is different, allowing for multiple statistic files in a singleplayer world.

**1.7.10 Build 20 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- Command computers can be used to run any command in the game. This is different to the teachers menu in that this can be acheived by a non op player by using the command computer datapack linked in "Mods & Extra Files". It can also be obtained in survival without using the teacher menu or commands by downgrading prismarine.
- The disk drive, wireless modem, monitor, printer, and advanced monitor all have the numeric id of 166, and data values of 0,1,2,3, and 4, respectively. The numeric id of 166 later converts to barriers, which are unobtainable in survival by normal means. Updating these items allows for both normal barriers and invalid data value barriers to be obtained.
- The computer process allows for the writing of external files, meaning essentially any file can be created within the world save, all of which would be discontinued. Upon world save the computer folder is generated, which is a discontinued folder.

**14w02a**
- Completely reworked villager trades. Almost all trades will be discontinued in future versions, either by trade, amount, or tier it is within. Some specific trades that will be discontinued are: Shepherds Selling All 16 Wool Colors, Librarians Buying 2 Written Books, and Leatherworkers Selling Enchanted Leather Tunic. Trades are now generated based on tier and are more specifically ordered. All trades from previous versions are considered tier 0 trades, meaning all trades from this version can be stacked on top of trades from previous versions.
- Clerics currently buy enderpearls, which will become unobtainable in future versions.
- Currently the files village_nether.dat and villages_end.dat generate in the data folder. These are discontinued files.
- Data is again stored by username instead of UUID. This allows for a statistic file with the players username that will not convert to a UUID. This also means that statistics will not be accurately tracked during this version. This occurs because the change to UUID was based on real world time instead of version ordering. 

**14w02a - 1.7.10**
- Downgrading villagers from 14w02a causes all trades to become tier 0 trades. This would allow you to update back to 14w02a, and get the same trades stacked on top. This downgrade and update cycle can be repeated for well over 100 trades in the first tier. This also allows for villagers of different careers to have trades on the same villager (for example shepherd trades and fletcher trades can both be on the same villager using this bug)

**14w04a**
- The id for cooked fish is now "cooked_fish" instead of "cooked_fished" This change partially breaks old villagers trading fish, but no discontinued trades are created. These broken villagers will allow for chunk regeneration in future versions, and by extension discontinued block configurations.

- By downgrading a shield from the previous version, negative durability shields can be created. This works by taking at least two shields in the previous version, and getting the durability lower than roughly 140 at least. The lower the durability, the easier to combine. Once these low durability shields are obtained, they can be downgraded to this version and combined in a crafting table. This will make the shields receive a lower durability, and can consistently be combined to as low as roughly -32400 durability. Anything lower than roughly -160 durability will remain negative when updated.
