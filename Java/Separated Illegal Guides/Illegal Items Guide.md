**Indev 20100124-3**
- The Indev House will spawn upon loading the world, within the Indev House chests full of 99 count items will spawn which is unobtainable in future versions. Among these items are bedrock, grass, and infinite lava items. The Infinite Water Items, 16 Cloth Colors, Sponges, Coal Ore, Obsidian and leaves can also be obtained and will convert to an unobtainable in future versions.
- Exploding A Chest while keeping it open will cause the items inside the chest to convert to 0 stack items. These items are useful for duplication, overstacked items, and understacked items. A 0 Stack item is a the most well known duplication method and java illegal, once you have it you can right click in your inventory and it will give you and infinite amount of diamonds. Every time you right click the 0 stack item, the item count will start going into the negatives allowing for negative durability stacked items, and once it reaches -129 it will overlap and the item count will become +127. This method of 0 stack items works all the way to Alpha 1.2.6

**Indev 20100128-2**

- The Player would spawn with 999 stacks of axes, shovels, pickaxes, torches, flint and steel, oak planks, glass blocks, and arrows every time you load the world. These are technically -25 stacks which is obtainable, but because of the Chest crash they can not be moved to chests in this version.
