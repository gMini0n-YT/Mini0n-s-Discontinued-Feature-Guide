**Indev 20100124-3**
- The Indev House will spawn upon loading the world, within the Indev House chests full of 99 count items will spawn which is unobtainable in future versions. Among these items are bedrock, grass, and infinite lava items. The Infinite Water Items, 16 Cloth Colors, Sponges, Coal Ore, Obsidian and leaves can also be obtained and will convert to an unobtainable in future versions.
- Exploding A Chest while keeping it open will cause the items inside the chest to convert to 0 stack items. These items are useful for duplication, overstacked items, and understacked items. A 0 Stack item is a the most well known duplication method and java illegal, once you have it you can right click in your inventory and it will give you and infinite amount of diamonds. Every time you right click the 0 stack item, the item count will start going into the negatives allowing for negative durability stacked items, and once it reaches -129 it will overlap and the item count will become +127. This method of 0 stack items works all the way to Alpha 1.2.6

**Indev 20100128-2**
- Indev Chests would spawn with 100 count items allowing for overstacked items

**Indev 20100206-2**

- The Player would spawn with 999 stacks of axes, shovels, pickaxes, torches, flint and steel, oak planks, glass blocks, and arrows every time you load the world. These are technically -25 stacks which is obtainable, but because of the Chest crash they can not be moved to chests in this version.

**Infdev 20100607**
- If a sign is destroyed from neighbor updates produced from its placement, it will crash the game. This crash will avoid the check to remove the sign item when the placement code is processed, so a sign zero stack will be left in the player's inventory upon reloading. This is easily accomplished by placing two non-opaque blocks (e.g. glass, slabs) next to each other and placing a sign on top of each. Placing the second sign will cause the first to be destroyed, which will update the second sign and destroy it, causing the crash.

**Infdev 20100625-2**

**Beta 1.6-tb3**
> [!Note]
> The level.dat and level.dat_old will need to be removed, either temporarily or permanetly in order to allow for the test build chests to generate in this version. In order to access the world after removing level.dat, you can go to create world and create a world with the same name as the world save. It is also recommended to use the same seed to prevent chunk borders. It is recommended to replace the original level.dat after entering this version in order to preserve the discontinued world name from the previous versions.
- Upon level.dat creation, debug chests would generate at the world spawn and contain every item in the game at the time including illegal items.

The zip file can then be extracted, and the folder titled "enable" can be zipped. This enabled zip can then be added to a b1.9-pre2 instance in multimc by going to edit instance and add to minecraft.jar. You can find this mod in the "Mods & Extra Files" folder
- Potions can be brewed by adding an assortment of ingredients to a cauldron. A total of 5,339 potion variations are possible using this method, most of which provide discontinued status effects and create invalid data value potions.

- Feeding animals would cause the wheat to decrement past 0 if it was the last item in the stack

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3-1**
> [!Note]

- Currently there is a bug that allows for commands to be run in survival. This is known as Cross Word Commands, and it functions by first creating a creative world. From the creative world a redstone setup can be made to generate a large amount of lag at the same time it runs command blocks. The player then quickly logs out of the creative world and into the survival world, which has a chance to transfer the commands and have them run in survival. A creative world download will be added to "Mods & Extra Files"

**15w31a**
- Endermen now drop the block they are holding, allowing for an assortment of items that are normally unobtainable if the endermen from b1.8-pre1 are killed.

This works by taking at least two shields in the previous version, and getting the durability lower than roughly 140 at least. The lower the durability, the easier to combine. Once these low durability shields are obtained, they can be downgraded to this version and combined in a crafting table. This will make the shields receive a lower durability, and can consistently be combined to as low as roughly -32400 durability. Anything lower than roughly -160 durability will remain negative when updated.

**1.9 Prerelease 1**
- Written books can be stored in unloaded chunks in this version until 1.13-pre3. This will allow for a different variant of a no nbt data written book with an empty tag.

> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- In several dimensions, including the "~N" dimension, player heads generate, which are normally not obtainable.  They can then be mined, drop as items, and thus be brought to the overworld.
- Within the fleet dimensions, end city ships generate. These ships contain written books instead of elytra. These written books have an unobtainable author name, being "Â§kDeepest Lore", which causes the written book to have an obfuscated author. These books also contain obfuscated text.
- By clicking on an infinite box of books, a written book pops out. This book will have the unobtainable author name of "Â§kUniverse itself", and thus will be obfuscated. The title of the book will be based off the coordinates of the infinite box of books, and will contain random text inside.
- In the "llama" dimension, there is a book within a hidden chest written by "Developer". This book is unobtainable in the world unless your username is Developer.

- Maps made in other dimensions will have be of an invalid dimension upon updating. This also occurs for explorer maps, including woodland mansion maps, ocean monument maps, and treasure maps. Therefore, there can also be villagers selling invalid dimension explorer maps.
- Placing a lodestone in one of the new dimensions and clicking it with a compass will create a compass attached to that dimension. These invalid dimension lodestone compasses will not be obtainable in future versions.

**20w14a - 20w13b (Downgrading)**
- By downgrading a warped fungus on a stick from the previous version, negative durability warped fungus on a stick can be created. This works by taking at least two warped fungi on a stick in the previous version, and getting the durability lower than roughly 70 at least. The lower the durability, the easier to combine. Once these low durability warped fungi on a stick are obtained, they can be downgraded to this version and combined in a crafting table. This will make the warped fungus on a stick receive a lower durability, and can consistently be combined to as low as roughly -2 billion durability. Anything lower than roughly -125 durability will remain negative when updated.

**1.16-Prerelease 6**
- Piglins can now spawn wearing enchanted golden armor, holding enchanted golden swords, and holding enchanted crossbows. Each bastion remnant visited with the world open, adds another layer of enchantments to the equipment held and worn by piglins in bastions. This allows for a wide variety of discontinued enchantment configurations, including conflicting and duplicate enchantments. Duplicate enchantments will be deleted in future versions, but the conflicting enchantments will be preserved.

**Combat Test 7a**
- Potions stack to 16, allowing for all potion varieties to be overstacked

**1.16.3 Release Candidate 1**
- Updating overstacked potions from the previous combat test versions allows you to combine the stacks of 16 into larger stacks, allowing for all potions stacked to 64

**20w45a**
- Bundles currently only stack to one, however 16 bundles can be picked up within a bundle, allowing for overstacked bundles
- Using bundles within the crafting interface allows for certain items to be overstacked. The method requires putting stacked items into a crafting recipe, and then using a bundle to remove one of the ingredients. This doesn't update the output, so taking the output increases the stack size of all remaining ingredients in the crafting grid. This allows for overstacked honey bottles, and overstacked banners and shields.
- Currently 64 bee nests can be placed inside a bundle regardless of nbt data. In future versions, bee nests with nbt data related to bees will only be able to stack to 1 in a bundle, allowing for overstacked bee nests in bundles.

**20w48a**
- By emptying a bundle in the inventory, an empty item tag is created. This empty tag is normally not obtainable.

**21w19a**
- Any bundles with multiple bee nests with nbt will now become bundles with too many items. By right clicking on these bundles with any item, the item can be overstacked and duplicated, allowing for every item in the game to be overstacked in this version.
- By overstacking items inside the bundle, items can be left clicked onto the bundle, and it creates item slots with air and a negative count, however it does also copy the nbt creating bundles full of nbt. Using these nbt bundles with large amounts of nbt data, for example chunk savestating books, can be used to overfill a chunk and perform both chunk savestating and chunk regeneration, which will be further utilized in later versions.

**1.17.1 - 21w05a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Deepslate, Chiseled Deepslate, Polished Deepslate, Deepslate Tiles, Cracked Deepslate Tiles, Deepslate Bricks, Cracked Deepslate Bricks, Cobbled Deepslate, Deepslate Lapis Lazuli Ore, Deepslate Redstone Ore, Deepslate Diamond Ore, Deepslate Emerald Ore, Deepslate Gold Ore, Deepslate Iron Ore, Deepslate Copper Ore, Deepslate Coal Ore, Infested Deepslate, Smooth Basalt, Waxed Variants for Oxidized Copper Variants, Raw Iron, Raw Copper, Raw Gold, Raw Iron Blocks, Raw Copper Blocks, Raw Gold Blocks, and any Deepslate Variants of Walls, Stairs, or Slabs will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items.

**21w05a - 21w03a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing  Azaleas, Azalea Leaves, Flowering Azalea Leaves, Cave Vines, Glowberries, Big Dripleaf, Small Dripleaf, Hanging Roots, Moss Blocks, Moss Carpets, and Rooted Dirt will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (192 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**21w03a - 20w51a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Glow Lichen, Glow Ink Sacs, and Glow Item Frames will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (256 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w51a - 20w48a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Bucket of Axolotl will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the item will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include this item. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (320 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w48a - 20w46a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Dripstone Blocks and Pointed Dripstone will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (384 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w45a (Mod)**
> [!Note]
> This version requires a Caves & Cliffs Datapack. The 21w15a Caves & Cliffs Datapack can be downloaded from the "Mods & Extra Files" folder. From here, the zip folder can directly be placed into the datapacks folder within the world save folder.
- Downgrading bundles containing a Powdered Snow Bucket will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the item will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include this item. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (448 if stacked with the previous bundle). It is recommended to combine this with 64 unique bee nests within the bundle for the maximum bundle size.

**21w39a - 21w37a (Downgrading)**
- Currently washing a banner in a cauldron cause it to retain the id tag while losing all of the patterns, creating a blank banner with an unnecessary nbt tag. By placing and breaking this banner it will change the tag to be an empty pattern tag. These are two variants of banners that will be discontinued in future versions.

**1.19-Exp 1**
> [!Note]]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Added the swift sneak enchantment, which currently can be applied to boots. This enchantment will be a leggings exclusive enchantment in future versions, making swift sneak enchanted boots unobtainable.

**22w13oneBlockAtATime**
- Various items can be obtained in this version that are not normally obtainable. Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Petrified Oak Slabs, and End Portal Frames can all be obtained either through an enderman handing them to the player, and then storing them in a donkey or storing them as a falling entity, which is then dropped onto a torch in the following version. Storing them as an item will maintain the blockstate tag, whereas storing them as an entity will drop them without any nbt data. End portal frames also generate naturally in nether fortress loot table chests.
- Endermen can also spawn holding "generic_item_block"s, allowing for every item not normally obtainable, including spawn eggs, debug stick, knowledge book, and command block minecart
- End Gateways can be obtained in both the nether and end, as enderman can spawn holding these blocks, and the player can pick up these blocks and place them in other dimensions. Similarly, nether portals can be obtained in the end through this same method.
- Every arrangement of an invalid blockstate is theoretically obtainable, as endermen can spawn with blocks with any blockstate, which can then be placed. Several examples are only possible through this method, such as waterlogged soul campfires, all direction false vines, and waterlogged double slabs.
- Any block can be converted to a falling entity by using a dropper, or by throwing a block. These can be stored by dropping them onto block 36.  There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game.
- Picking up blocks allows for items with the blockstate tag. Blocks that do not normally store a blockstate will have an empty blockstate tag, and all blocks that normally have a blockstate can have numerous blockstate tags. Certain blockstate tags, such as "waterlogged:true" can only be obtained when handed to the player by an enderman, which can occur by angering an enderman and letting it hit the player.

**22w14a**
- Added Recovery Compasses, which point to the location where the player last died. Currently, by having exactly two recovery compasses in a stack, and clicking both of them on a lodestone, one will become a recovery compass with lodestone tags, which will be discontinued in the next version.

**22w45a**
- Currently trying to place a book into a full chiseled bookshelf duplicates the book and increases the stack size. This allows for overstacked enchanted books, book and quills, and written books, and is the first overstacking method for any enchanted book with swift sneak

**23w05a**
- Potion effects can now be made infinite when the potion effect is set to a duration of -1. These infinite effects should normally be unobtainable, however by layering a lower level longer duration potion with the equivalent higher level shorter duration potion in a specific order, an infinite effect can be created.

**23w07a**
- Suspicious sand is not supposed to be obtainable as an item. However, by dropping it into a bubble column, cobwebs, or the end portal, it still drops.
- Crafting decorated pots creates a shard list tag. In future versions this will be a sherd list tag, however updating these will maintain the shard tag creating discontinued pot variants. This tag is not visible.

**23w12a**
- Suspicious gravel is not supposed to be obtainable as an item. However, by dropping it into a bubble column, cobwebs, or the end portal, it still drops.

**23w13a_or_b**
- The votes to replace any inventory item and replace any crafting output preserves the nbt of the item and transfers it to the new item. Pairing this with the nbt crafting allows for any nbt on any item, technically also allowing for any item through the use of container inventory. This works by getting a replace item to replace a compound tag with a container of some sort, which is incredibly rare when multiplying these odds together. This by extension also allows for no nbt on items that normally would have nbt, such as suspicious stews.
- Added votes that replace any inventory item, any crafting output, or any loot drop with a random item. These votes, along with the vote that replaces villager emeralds, allow for any item, including normally discontinued items. This includes Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Path Blocks, Petrified Oak Slabs, End Portal Frames, Frogspawn, Reinforced Deepslate, Suspicious Sand & Gravel, Spawn Eggs, Command Block Minecarts, Knowledge Books, and Debug Sticks.
- Added votes that will give a player a random item and allow a chicken to lay a random item instead of an egg. This allows for any item in the game, including Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Path Blocks, Petrified Oak Slabs, End Portal Frames, Frogspawn, Reinforced Deepslate, Suspicious Sand & Gravel, Spawn Eggs, Command Block Minecarts, Knowledge Books, and Debug Sticks.
- Added a vote that allows for fishing anything. This includes being able to fish discontinued items, such as Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Path Blocks, End Portal Frames, Frogspawn, Reinforced Deepslate, Suspicious Sand & Gravel, Spawn Eggs, Luck Potions and Arrows, Paintings with Type NBT, and Bucket of Fish without any NBT values
- Added a vote to double or halve the stack size of a random item. This allows for every item to be overstacked to 127, and stacks of 127 of every item in every container
- Dupe hack items can be crafted with any other item in the crafting table to duplicate the item. This allows for a stack of 2 of any item crafted with the dupe hack, which can then be combined further into larger stacks. This allows for every item to be overstacked to 64.
- Using the replace item in inventory vote to replace a stacked item with an unstackable item creates an overstacked item
- Added a vote to give a random entity a percent chance of dropping their respective spawn egg. This allows for every spawn egg to be obtained.
- Added a vote that allows player heads to drop from players killed by charged creepers. This allows for not only player heads, but also custom player heads with player data.
- Moon lab shulkers that generate in lunar bases can have unobtainable items as loot, including budding amethyst, cow spawn eggs, sheep spawn eggs, and villager spawn eggs
- Putting a normal stack of items in a bundle, and then voting to increase that item's stack size to greater than 64 makes the bundle behave as if it is empty, allowing another stack of items to be placed inside. This can be repeated indefinitely every time a stack size vote appears. Note that attempting to place items in a bundle while their stack size is set at above 64 will crash the game
- Added a vote called the midas touch. This will convert every item in the player's inventory into golden equivalents, allowing for any nbt tag on golden ingots when paired with nbt crafting, as well as any normal nbt on various golden items. This also allows for negative durability on every piece of golden armor and tools.
- Mining the dropper or chest from the lunar base drops the respective item with a custom translation string. Similarly, using a piston to break any of the shulker boxes generated in the lunar structure drops shulker boxes with custom translation strings and loot tables.
- The vote to replace villager trades also allows for usually discontinued no nbt items, including blank enchanted books, empty written books, no nbt suspicious stew and bee nests
- The votes that give a player a random item or allow a chicken to lay a random item instead of an egg will also give the player no nbt items. This allows for blank enchanted books, empty written books, no nbt suspicious stew and bee nests, and uncraftable potion variants, among other things.
- Big and small potions have custom potion effects of big and small, which upon updating will convert to uncraftable potions with these respective potion tags
- Dupe hack items can be crafted with any other item in the crafting interface to duplicate the item. This allows for crafting outputs of any item, and thus crafting statistics for every single item, even items not normally craftable.
- Votes that change crafting output and villager emeralds allow for the player to obtain any item through crafting, and thus acheive crafting statistics for any item.
- Using a map on the moon creates a map with dimension data of the moon, which is not normally obtainable
- The dream mode vote allows for treasure and higher level enchantments from an enchantment table. This allows for treasure enchantments on items without repair cost, which depending on the material used is not normally obtainable (such as turtle shells).
- Added vote rules to create backwards diamond swords and bows. These crafting recipes craft the respective item, but with an nbt tag of "wob:1b". This is a discontinued nbt tag.
- Placing a lodestone on the moon and using a compass on it creates a lodestone compass with dimension data of the moon.

**23w51a**
- Crafting suspicious stews with a dandelion or a blue orchid creates a 7 second stew instead of a 7 tick stew, which are unobtainable variants. This also works to create discontinued mooshroom variants by feeding them the respective flowers.

**24w03a**
- Currently sword enchants can apply to axes and thorns can apply to non chestplate armor in the enchantment table, allowing for these items to have these enchantments without repair cost. Normally these enchantments on these respective items are only obtainable through an anvil, and thus will have repair cost.

**24w09a**
- Grindstoning enchanted books adds the Damage:0 tag to the book, which is an invalid nbt tag.

**24w10a**
- By placing two of the same items into the grindstone slots, the enchantments of the item in the bottom slot will be transferred to the item in the top slot. This only works for items that have durability, however it allows for all enchantments to be combined on a single item without repair cost, and many instances of incompatible enchantment combinations.
- Loading bee nest or beehive items with honey levels from 24w07a or before will convert the honey level tag to true or false instead of remaining a number. Since this value is supposed to be a number, this is a discontinued tag, and is also completely unobservable.

**24w14potato-1**
> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Bundle datapack. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Poisonous potatoes now stack to 99. Updating them out of this version will cause them to reset to the stack of 64, however by storing them in unloaded chunks until 1.20.5 Pre-release 1 or later overstacked poisonous potatoes can be preserved.
- Following the potato quest instructions to take a bed from a village will result in a piece of paper with lore being placed in the player's inventory, as well as a written book with the author "P.P.P.". Both of these items are not normally obtainable.
- Enchanted books with potatofication can be obtained through an enchanting table. Updating these enchanted books will remove this enchantment, creating blank enchanted books.
- Placing a lodestone in the potato dimension and using a compass on it creates a lodestone compass with dimension data of potato
- Maps made in the potato dimension will have an invalid dimension after updating. This also occurs for buried treasure maps.

**24w13a**
> [!Note]
> In order to get librarians trading the new enchanted books, the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack has to be disabled, and to load this world out of the april fools version, both of which can be performed through world save insertion. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21 and the Bundle datapack, and then toggle the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack to off. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files. This same process can be repeated to reenable the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack.
- Density and breach are not mutually exclusive with each other or with smite or bane of arthropods. In future versions all these enchantments will be mutually exclusive, making enchanted books and maces with these enchantment combinations discontinued enchantment combos.
- Arrows spawned by the ominous spawners can be normal arrows with potion contents of either poison or slowness IV, both of which are discontinued arrow variants that cannot normally be obtained

**24w13a - 24w11a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading an enchanted mace and placing it into the bottom slot of a grindstone will transfer any enchantments to a mace placed in the top of the grindstone. This allows for all normal mace enchantments that exist in this version to be applied on a mace without repair cost, as well as conflicting enchantments of smite and bane of arthropods on a mace.
- Downgrading enchanted books with the Breach, Density, or Wind Burst enchantments will remove these enchantments creating blank enchanted books. This also applies for villagers selling these books, allowing for discontinued trades.
- Downgrading tipped arrows of Wind Charging, Oozing, Infestation, or Weaving will remove the potion effect, creating uncraftable tipped arrows. This also applies for villagers selling these tipped arrows, allowing for discontinued trades.
- Downgrading ominous banners and explorer maps will remove translatable components, creating discontinued variants of these items that lack custom names. This also applies for villagers selling explorer maps, allowing for discontinued trades, and pillager captains holding ominous banners, allowing for entities holding invalid items.
- Downgrading potions of Wind Charging, Oozing, Infestation, or Weaving will remove the potion effect, creating uncraftable potions

**24w18a**
- Maces can currently have sharpness applied in an anvil, which will not be obtainable in future versions
- Using any item with both durability and enchanted with fire aspect or soul speed will decrease the durability, but not break the item. This allows for swords, axes, maces, boots, leggings, and any item from 12w49a all with 0 durability.

**24w20a**
- Depleting a warped fungus on a stick and breaking it causes it to convert to a fishing rod, however it maintains the durability of the warped fungus on a stick. This creates negative durability fishing rods with exactly -36 durability.

**24w33a**
- Scooping up a Bucket of Salmon will not store it's size nbt tag

**24w36a**
- Golden armor has the same durability as iron armor. By damaging this armor past the normal amount for gold, negative durability armor can be obtained. This cannot be combined in future versions to go lower.

**25w03a**
- Axolotls picked up in water buckets do not save their variant in the resulting bucket of axolotl. These buckets of axolotl update into later versions where you can only obtain buckets of axolotl with a variant saved. This bucket will always spawn a lucy (pink) axolotl. It is observable because it only has 11 components instead of the normal 12 on a bucket of axolotl.

**25w14craftmine**
- Unlocking the "Starter Compass" will give you a compass with an illegal dimension nbt saved to it depending on the mine it is created in
- After unlocking the 'Varangian' unlock, entering a mine gives the player a netherite axe with Sharpness V and Looting III. Looting is normally not obtainable on axes and sharpness is normally only obtainable via anvils, which add repair cost.
- After unlocking the 'Dirt Connoisseur' unlock any dirt making its way into the player's inventory will turn it consumable including Coarse Dirt, Grass Block, Moss Block, Mud, Muddy Mangrove Roots, Mycelium, Pale Moss Block, Podzol and Rooted Dirt.
- Several of the unlocks in 25w14craftmine make the player start with an enchanted item. These enchanted items don't have repair cost. During the enchanting process in the enchanting table a singular modified level gets used to find the list of possible enchantments and their levels, which means that there are combinations which cannot be obtained while enchanting (for example you can't get an efficiency 5 fortune 1 pickaxe). Here is a list of enchanted items from unlocks whose enchantment combination is not obtainable from an enchanting table (the levels which allow for the specific enchantment is listed in brackets):
Golden Pickaxe from Silky Pick: Silk Touch (15-65), Unbreaking I (5-12), Diamond Pickaxe from Lucky Pick: Fortune III (33-83), Efficiency IV (31-40), Unbreaking I (5-12), Iron Sword from You call that a knoife?: Sharpness III (23-33), Sweeping Edge I (5-13), Diamond Sword from Shiny Sword: Sharpness III (23-33), Sweeping Edge II (14-22), Looting II (24-32), Netherite Sword from No Nether Needed: Sharpness V (45-65), Sweeping Edge II (14-22), Looting II (24-32)
