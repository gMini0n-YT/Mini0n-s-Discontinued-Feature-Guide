**Indev 20100124-3**
- The Indev House will spawn upon loading the world, within the Indev House chests full of 99 count items will spawn which is unobtainable in future versions. Among these items are bedrock, grass, and infinite lava items. The Infinite Water Items, 16 Cloth Colors, Sponges, Coal Ore, Obsidian and leaves can also be obtained and will convert to an unobtainable in future versions.
- Exploding A Chest while keeping it open will cause the items inside the chest to convert to 0 stack items. These items are useful for duplication, overstacked items, and understacked items. A 0 Stack item is a the most well known duplication method and java illegal, once you have it you can right click in your inventory and it will give you and infinite amount of diamonds. Every time you right click the 0 stack item, the item count will start going into the negatives allowing for negative durability stacked items, and once it reaches -129 it will overlap and the item count will become +127. This method of 0 stack items works all the way to Alpha 1.2.6

**Beta 1.4-1** 
- Locked Chests can generate throughout the world if your computer time is set to April 1st, 2011. You can obtain them from explosions, they will convert to stained glass in the future allowing for several illegal block formations

**Beta 1.6-tb3**
> [!Note]
> The level.dat and level.dat_old will need to be removed, either temporarily or permanetly in order to allow for the test build chests to generate in this version. In order to access the world after removing level.dat, you can go to create world and create a world with the same name as the world save. It is also recommended to use the same seed to prevent chunk borders. It is recommended to replace the original level.dat after entering this version in order to preserve the discontinued world name from the previous versions.
- Upon level.dat creation, debug chests would generate at the world spawn and contain every item in the game at the time including illegal items. These items include Half Bed, Flowing Water, Water, Flowing Lava, Lava, Double Stone Slab, Fire, Redstone Wire, Crops, Farmland, Lit Furnace, Standing Sign, Wall Sign, Half Wooden Door, Half Iron Door, Lit Redstone Ore, Unlit Redstone Torch, Reeds, Portal, Cake Block, Unpowered Redstone Repeater, Powered Redstone Repeater, Locked Chest, Shrub, and Bedrock
- Entering a Nether Portal while in the crafting grid will cause all items in the crafting grid to get thrown out and become 0 stacked items, 0 stack items can be subtracted to become negative stack items by Q-ing them and can be overflowed to become overstacked items
- Maps would not snap to a grid, meaning unobtainable map variants can be obtained
