**Alpha 1.2.2**
- In this version it is possible to get to the Farlands in under an hour. The way to do this is to summon a nether portal and place a boat in it, get into the boat, and once you go through the nether the game will become glitched and you will become stuck in the nether portal animation. Save and Quit the game, and when you load back in you will be at the same coordinates in the nether as you were in the overworld. When you generate another portal and go through your coordinates in the overworld will be multiplied 8 times. Doing this over again will cause your coords to multiply 8 types each time until you are all the way at the farlands
- Nether Portals can be summoned by pressing F4 which can be used to get to the Farlands and to create illegal block formations
