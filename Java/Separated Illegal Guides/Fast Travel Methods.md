**Alpha 1.2.2**
- In this version it is possible to get to the Farlands in under an hour. The way to do this is to summon a nether portal and place a boat in it, get into the boat, and once you go through the nether the game will become glitched and you will become stuck in the nether portal animation. Save and Quit the game, and when you load back in you will be at the same coordinates in the nether as you were in the overworld. When you generate another portal and go through your coordinates in the overworld will be multiplied 8 times. Doing this over again will cause your coords to multiply 8 types each time until you are all the way at the farlands
- Nether Portals can be summoned by pressing F4 which can be used to get to the Farlands and to create illegal block formations

**15w34a**
- From 15w34a (1.9 snapshot) to 1.12.1[1], and 1.13 to 1.13.2[2], being inside of a nether portal and throwing an ender pearl will multiply the player's coordinates by â…› if performed in the Overworld, or 8 if performed in the Nether. This can be done to easily reach the world border. This is safest to perform on the nether roof, because the player can be spawned inside of a wall if performed below the roof, or take a dip into a lava lake. The same may happen in the overworld, but performing the warp at a Y level higher than most terrain (y=100 typically is sufficient) will cause the pearl to simply fall to the surface, allowing for safe teleportation
