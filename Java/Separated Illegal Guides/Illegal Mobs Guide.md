_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Alpha 1.2.0**
- Zombie Pigmen and skeletons appear to hold their weapons but it is all visual, updating these two mobs past 1.3 will turn them into weaponless weaponless mobs

**Beta 1.8 Prerelease 1-1**
- Endermen can pick up any block in the game allowing for discontinued endermen variants

**11w49a**
- Pressing B changes the clientside gamemode to creative. This allows for Bedrock, Sponge, Chainmail Armor, Ice, and Creeper, Skeleton, Spider, Zombie, Slime, Ghast, Pig Zombie, Enderman, Cave Spider, Silverfish, Blaze, Magma Cube, Pig, Sheep, Cow, Chicken, Squid, Wolf, Mooshroom, and Villager Spawn Eggs. This also allows for easy bedrock removal.
- Using spawn eggs for mobs with weapons (e.g Skeleton, and Pig Zombie) for the B Creative Mode will spawn them without weapons

**12w08a**
- Iron Golems current have no knockback resistance which will not revert when updating to newer versions allowing for discontinued variants of the iron golem

**0.982 Classroom (EDU)**
- There is a teacher menu that allows for the teacher to enter creative mode and also gives numerous discontinued items.
- Currently any command can be run by joining the game as a teacher all while being in survival mode.

**12w21a**
- Villagers now have trades. Every single villager trade will become unobtainable in future versions, whether through invalid prices or invalid items. Villager trades are not based on tiers and trade amounts can vary. Eyes of enders and rotten flesh can currently be bought, which will no longer be possible in the next two versions. Bottles of enchanting are obtainable through trading now.

**12w32a-2**
- Zombie Pigmen that spawn in this version appear to be holding the correct items, but in reality they are holding zombie gear (iron shovels, iron swords, or nothing)
- Pigs that are struck by lightning will spawn Zombie Pigmen that are holding nothing
- Villagers now trade different arrow and paper amounts which will become unobtainable in future versions.

**1.4.4**
- Baby mobs can be spawned by using spawn eggs on the parents. So using a wolf spawn egg on an ownerless wolf creates an ownerless baby wolf which will become unobtainable in future versions

**13w06a-1**
- All minecarts will be converted to spawner minecarts which will become unobtainable later

**Minecraft 2.0-Red (April Fools)**
- In Super Hostile Mode, lightning will strike every 2-5 minutes spawning Wool Headed Zombies, Wool Headed Skeletons, and Wool Haded Zombie Pigmen and Pigmen with Battle Signs among many others, pushing these mobs into a portal will cause them to not despawn when the lightning strike resets, you can then update to 13w16b to obtain name tags and name all the wool headed mobs and save them for future updates
- Zombie Pigmen will spawn naturally in the nether holding Battle Signs, these Battle signs would hold certain enchantments including Sharpness/Smite/Bane of Arthropods, Looting, Fire Aspect, and Knockback. Killing the pigmen will give a chance of dropping the Battle Sign

**13w16a-2**
- Added Horses, Donkeys, and Mules. These mobs can have much faster speed values than future versions, as well as jump values that will become discontinued in the future.

**13w21a**
- Updating Mobs from this version into future version will allow for unobtainable variants of mobs due to speed change
- Wild Horses can be saddled in this version

**13w36a-1**
- Currently reloading a villager removes the second buy slot item. This allows for free enchantment trades on clerics and it only costs a book for an enchanted book, as well as gravel to flint conversion for free. These will all be unobtainable trades in future versions.

**13w49a**
- Added Chicken Jockeys. Chickens in chicken jockeys currently lay eggs, as the "IsJockey" tag does not exist yet. Chickens also maintain agression against the player after the zombie is dead, despite not being able to deal damage.
- Zombies, zombie villagers, and zombie pigmen (if made weaponless first) chicken jockeys could pick up eggs from 13w49a to 1.7.10.

**14w02a**
- Completely reworked villager trades. Almost all trades will be discontinued in future versions, either by trade, amount, or tier it is within. Some specific trades that will be discontinued are: Shepherds Selling All 16 Wool Colors, Librarians Buying 2 Written Books, and Leatherworkers Selling Enchanted Leather Tunic. Trades are now generated based on tier and are more specifically ordered. All trades from previous versions are considered tier 0 trades, meaning all trades from this version can be stacked on top of trades from previous versions.
- Clerics currently buy enderpearls, which will become unobtainable in future versions.
- Clerics currently sell eyes of enders, which ill become unobtainable in future versions
- In 14w02a (a 1.8 snapshot), farmer villagers were supposed to sell cake at tier 4. However, due to a bug farmer villagers will instead sell the Cake (Block Item) for 1 emerald. As the cake block does not have a registered item in 13w37a (a 1.7 snapshot) and above, opening this villager's GUI before reloading from disk after unlocking its tier 4 trades will crash the game whilst trying to write the villager's trades to the trade packet. When the villager is saved to disk, 0 is written as the item id, converting it to air.
- Due to a bug, from 14w02a - 14w30c (1.8 Snapshots) bottles o' enchanting were unavailable as a last tier trade from cleric villagers.

**14w02a - 1.7.10 (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading villagers from 14w02a causes all trades to become tier 0 trades. This would allow you to update back to 14w02a, and get the same trades stacked on top. This downgrade and update cycle can be repeated for well over 100 trades in the first tier. This also allows for villagers of different careers to have trades on the same villager (for example shepherd trades and fletcher trades can both be on the same villager using this bug)

**14w04a**
- The id for cooked fish is now "cooked_fish" instead of "cooked_fished" This change partially breaks old villagers trading fish, but no discontinued trades are created. These broken villagers will allow for chunk regeneration in future versions, and by extension discontinued block configurations.

**14w32a**
- Minecarts can pick up armor stands
- Currently overstacked armor can be dispensed onto an armor stand, which will be discontinued in future versions.
- Currently placed armor stands have minor poses. In future versions armor stands will have no poses, making these discontinued armor stand variants.

**15w14a**
> [!Note]
> In order to update to this version, the world folder must be renamed to "existence.af15"
- Attempting to trade with a villager does not give the proper item, but instead gives a paper renamed "Thanks for your donation". This paper is a discontinued item since it is renamed without a repair cost.
- Horses could be stacked on top of the player by right clicking them. They can be removed from riding the player by logging out, or submerging the stack into water. While both tamed and untamed horses could be added to the stack, untamed horses will randomly dismount their mounts, making them a temporary discontinued feature if the stack consists of untamed horses.

**1.8.9**
- Currently there is a bug that allows for commands to be run in survival. This is known as Cross Word Commands, and it functions by first creating a creative world. From the creative world a redstone setup can be made to generate a large amount of lag at the same time it runs command blocks. The player then quickly logs out of the creative world and into the survival world, which has a chance to transfer the commands and have them run in survival. A creative world download will be added to "Mods & Extra Files"
- During this version armored mobs can be stored in unloaded chunks until 18w19a or later. Keeping these mobs unloaded during this version range will create dual wielding mobs, or mobs holding boots and leggings in each hand. This allows for unobtainable mob variants. During this version, mobs can also be stored in unloaded chunks until 15w32a or later for mobs with 0 drop chance on their left hand.

**15w31a**
- Endermen now drop the block they are holding, allowing for an assortment of items that are normally unobtainable if the endermen from b1.8-pre1 are killed.

**15w32a**
- Loading the mobs stored in 1.8.9 will create 0 drop chance left hand mobs

**15w33a**
- Added items picked up and items dropped statistics. These can go negative by simply dropping or picking up negative stacks of items.

**15w33c**
- Fireballs shot out of a dispenser are dragon fireballs. This allows for dragon fireballs in the overworld and nether, which can become frozen projectiles. These projectiles are normally unobtainable in these dimensions.
- Resummoning the ender dragon also regenerates the end pillars. The ender crystals can be moved during this regeneration process, allowing for indestructable ender crystals which will be unobtainable in future versions.

**15w35a**
- Zombies and Zombie Pigmen spawn in this version with noAI. This allows for various NoAI mobs including Villagers and Drowneds

**15w38a**
- Sending a skeleton trapped horse to the nether allows for wither skeleton horsemen, which are unobtainable in future versions
- Skeleton horses currently spawn with higher health than is obtainable in future versions. The main skeleton horse spawns with 53 hp, and the other skeleton horses range from 15-30 hp

**15w41a**
- Currently any mobs can enter into a boat, this includes large mobs such as ghasts, and squids. This allows for an assortment of discontinued mobs in boats.
- An ender dragon can enter a boat, which will be discontinued in future versions
- Clerics now sell ender pearls instead of eye of enders, which is another discontinued trade

**15w44b**
- Relogging during the Dragon's resummoning process will cause all of the End Crystals present to become invincible

**16w20a**
- Endermen can spawn in the nether and can pick up netherack. In the future Endermen aren't able to pick up netherack
- If you kill a slime and unload it while it is dying, when reloaded it will have its health set above 0, which stops the mob from dying. However, the death timer is not reset.
- Any spider spawned in a cold biome with direct sky access could become a stray jockey instead of a normal spider jockey. The biome can be Snowy Tundra, Snowy Mountains, Ice Spikes, Frozen River, or Frozen Ocean. There is a 0.8% chance that any spider spawned will be a stray jockey. The spider can be only spawned from a spawner, or using a spawn egg, as natural spawning couldn't spawn jockeys at the time due to bug.

**16w21a**
- Dispensers can equip shields onto entities, including armor stands.

**16w32b**
- When a villager is generated, the tier one trades can be from an invalid profession and career. The career can also be set too high, causing only tier one trades to be added. Also, this allows for villagers to receive no trades, which is unobtainable until they are forced to get trades in future versions. This allows for a large variety of discontinued villagers
- Since villagers can receive invalid tier one trades, this also allows nitwits to receive tier one trades. Nitwits can normally not receive any trades, allowing for unobtainable nitwits.

**16w39a**
- Added cartographer villagers, which have trades that will be discontinued in future versions. They can also be combined with the invalid career villagers from 16w32b.
- Vindicators currently only visually appear to hold an axe, they do not actually hold an axe. This means updating them to future versions allows for weaponless vindicators

**1.12.2**
- There is a complex method known as pallette corruption, which can allow for any block to replace random blocks in the world. This is done with async observer lines, and can allow for various blocks including command blocks and structure blocks. This is not the first version this works in, but the last major version where this can occur.  https://mcdf.wiki.gg/wiki/Java_Edition:Parallel_Asynchronous_Threads
- There is a complex method known as Any Falling Block. This method allows for certain blocks to convert to an item by switching it with a falling block. This allows for end portal frames as items, among other things. This is not the first version this works in, but the last major version where this can occur.

**17w47a**
- Updating a villager with a pumpkin trade will convert that pumpkin to a carved pumpkin, allowing for a carved pumpkin trade. This is unobtainable in future versions.
- Fishermen now have a salmon trade, which is unobtainable in certain amounts in future versions
- Endermen could pick up snowy grass. They could also place it down and it would keep the state. If an enderman places or picks up snowy grass in a future version it simply converts to regular grass.

**18w01a**
- Throwing your Ender Pearl and then, reloading it, whether it is by leaving the chunks which the Ender Pearl is in or leaving and rejoining your world. The ender pearl will then lose its "Owner" tag, allowing for an Ownerless Enderpearl

**18w07a**
- Phantoms have a base attack damage of 6, which is unobtainable in future versions

**18w08b**
- Currently fish have a base health of 20, which is higher than in future versions, thus meaning it is unobtainable in future versions

- Loading the mobs from 1.8.9 will cause them to be dual wielding and holding armor. It also causes them to have a 0 drop chance for their left hand, which is also normally not obtainable.
- Leaving farmer villagers with melon trades unloaded until 18w21a will convert their melon trades to melon slice trades, allowing for discontinued trades.

**18w20c**
- Keeping enchanted books and villagers with enchanted book trades in unloaded chunks until 1.13 Pre-1 will convert the enchantments to numeric ids. This numeric id tag will be removed in future versions, however it will still allow for villagers trading blank enchanted books, allowing for discontinued villager variants and no nbt enchanted books.

**18w21a**
- Loading farmer villagers with melon trades from 18w20a or before will convert their melon trades to melon slice trades, allowing for discontinued trades.

**18w21b**
- Updating a villager with the map trades causes the translation string to break and receive extra text, resulting in a discontinued trade
- Updating a vindicator named "Johnny" will cause it to receive a different name, while still keeping the "Johnny: 1b" tag. This is unobtainable normally.

**18w22a**
- Updating enchanted books converts all enchantments to protection, allowing for protection V and multi protection enchanted books. Multiple protection enchantments will be deleted in future versions, however protection V will be preserved.
- Updating a villager with enchanted book trades converts the trades to protection, allowing for protection V book trades which are unobtainable normally.

**1.13 Prerelease 3**
- Updating an enchanted book from 18w20c or before causes the numeric enchantment id to stay on the book, which is normally unobtainable. This change also occurs with villagers, allowing for villager trading numeric id enchanted books. This numeric id tag will be removed in future versions, however it will still allow for villagers trading blank enchanted books, allowing for discontinued villager variants.

**18w43a**
- Currently armor can be dispensed onto a panda, allowing for armored pandas which are normally unobtainable

**18w45a**
- Pillagers currently can run out of durability on crossbows, leaving them weaponless. This will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Currently pillagers and vindicators spawn holding ominous banners that are missing one layer. Normally only complete ominous banners can be equipped.

**18w48a**
- Villagers that generate in the new villages are missing their tier one trade. This allows for a wide variety of discontinued trades.

**18w50a**
- There are now different biome variants of villagers. Currently the biome variant of a librarian villager does not affect the trade, however this will change in future versions, essentially causing all librarians to have discontinued enchanted book trades. Certain book trades will be discontinued across all variants, and certain book trades are only discontinued on specific biome variants.

**19w02a**
- Multiple protection types can be applied to enchanted books and armor, allowing for variuos assortments of normally unobtainable enchantment combinations. This also affects villager trades, allowing for villagers trading enchanted armor with invalid enchantments.

**19w07a**
- Added Foxes. Foxes can currently have armor dispensed onto them, allowing for armored foxes which are normally not obtainable.
- Armored foxes can wear armor with thorns, and thus can kill the player and increase the killed by fox statistic, which is normally unobtainable
- Foxes currently spawn with high health of 20 hp, which will change to 10 hp in future versions.

**19w11a**
- Armorer and Cartographer trades have been completely reworked, and will be discontinued in future versions, either by trade, amount, tier the trade is in, or based off of the biome variant
- Farmer villagers sell short duration suspicious stews as their expert tier trade. These durations will later be increased, allowing for several different discontinued trades. These suspicious stews are also discontinued themselves, allowing for the same amount of discontinued items. Additionally, different duration values of the already future discontinued speed suspicious stew are also obtainable through this method. The saturation stew obtained this method actually has a longer duration than normally possible.
- Fletcher villagers can sell tipped arrows as their master tier trade. This includes the arrow of luck, which is normally unobtainable. This allows for both a discontinued trade and a discontinued item.
- Toolsmith villagers can sell enchanted diamond hoes as their journeyman tier trade. This will later be changed to unenchanted diamond hoes, making this trade discontinued.
- Librarian villagers can sell 3 bookshelves for 6 emeralds, which will later become an unobtainable amount trade

**19w11a - 18w48b (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading villagers to this point removes their profession, career, and career level, converting all of their trades to tier 0, and converting the profession to a farmer. This allows for any trade existing on any villager in 19w11a (including old trades updated to 19w11a) is obtainable on a farmer profession villager. This farmer profession can be any one of the four farmer careers; farmer, fisherman, shepherd, or fletcher. By repeating downgrade, theoretically infinite trades can be obtained on this one villager by constantly converting the tier to 0.

**19w13a**
- Villagers will give the player gifts after a raid victory, including tipped arrows. One of these tipped arrows has an invalid potion effect of "speed", allowing for an uncraftable tipped arrow variant.
- Vindicators that spawn in raids spawn holding wooden or stone axes instead of iron axes, which are both normally unobtainable items held by the vindicator

**3D Shareware v1.34**
- Typing "HOWDOYOUTURNTHISON" spawns a tamed, ownerless horse with 200 hp and 3.0 jump and speed. These are all incredibly high effects, and normally unobtainable on a horse. This horse can be bred with other horses and donkeys, further allowing for mules and other horse variants with normally unobtainable effects.

**1.14**

- Currently piglins and hoglins that are within 16 blocks of a player do not despawn. This allows for persistence required 1b piglins and hoglins without names, which are normally not obtainable.
- Piglins that are holding a crossbow will drop their crossbow to pick up golden items. Normally a piglin needs to be holding a weapon, thus allowing for discontinued piglin variants.
- Baby piglins can currently pick up both soul torches and soul lanterns, however piglins are supposed to be afraid of soul items. In future versions, baby piglins will not be able to pick up soul items. Baby piglins can currently pick up leather, and in future versions baby piglins will also no longer be allowed to pick up leather.

**20w10a**
- If a creeper is duplicated, and then one duplicate is stored and another is exploded adjacent to a fireball, the owner of the fireball will change to be that of the creeper. The fireball can be made stationary by pushing it with a piston into a cobweb in order to preserve it.

**20w13a**
- Currently there is a chance striders will spawn with NoGravity:1b, meaning they float. These striders will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Striders can spawn on top of other striders. Currently there is no upper bound, allowing for 4+ strider stacks, which will be unobtainable in future versions.
- Striders can currently spawn with zombified piglins holding golden swords. This will be changed in future versions so the zombified piglins only hold warped fungi on a stick.

**20w14∞**
> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- In certain biomes in certain dimensions, zombie horses can spawn as passive mobs. A specific example is the biome "_generated:1913198024" in dimension "zz" around 381, -411. In this location, the area would have to have a sufficient light level and have grass blocks for spawning. Zombie horses can then spawn, as well as baby zombie horses, which can both then be brought to the overworld. Baby zombie horses can also be put into a boat, and then grown up and become an oversized mob in a boat.
- In several dimensions, including the "aaaaaaaaaaaaa" dimension, giants spawn. These giants can be pushed into a large nether portal or into an end portal, and thus be brought into the overworld. Giants are normally not obtainable in the world. there are also left hand variants of Giants that spawn.
- In several dimensions, including the "a" dimension, illusioners spawn, which are normally not obtainable. These illusioners can also be pillager captains. The illusioners can be brought through a nether portal back to the overworld.
- In the "missing" dimension, two iron golems spawn that are missing AI. These iron golems can be pushed into a nether portal, allowing for noAI iron golems in the overworld.
- In certain biomes in certain dimensions, skeleton horses can spawn as passive mobs. A specific example is the biome "_generated:773938501" in dimension "q3" around 1357, -1126. In this location, the area would have to have a sufficient light level and have grass blocks for spawning. Skeleton horses can then spawn, which can then be brought to the overworld. This allows for wild skeleton horses, as well as baby skeleton horses. The baby skeleton horses can also be put in boats, allowing for skeleton horses in a boat.
- In several dimensions, including the "5466788" dimension, wandering traders spawn. These wandering traders will not have a despawn timer, which allows for a variant of wandering trader that is normally not obtainable. Note that the wandering traders will be invisible, so it will be difficult to find them within the dimension. In order to keep these traders, they can be sent through a nether portal back into the overworld.
- In the "llama" dimension, there are llamas that generate which have lime carpets. These llamas are not tamed. Normally, untamed llamas wearing carpets are unobtainable.
- In the "isolation" dimension, there are three dogs that spawn, which have the owner set as the villager Bob. These dogs therefore have an invalid owner. These dogs can also have their collar dyed, which will be unobtainable for dogs with improper owners in future versions.
- Giants, illusioners, and zombie horses are all normally unobtainable mobs obtainable in this version. These mobs can all be killed by the player, and illusioners can kill the player, allowing for a variety of discontinued statistics.

**20w16a**
- Piglins and hoglins that generate in bastions have a speed level much higher than normally obtainable

**20w17a**
- Piglins that are holding a crossbow will drop their crossbow to pick up golden items. Normally a piglin needs to be holding a weapon, thus allowing for discontinued piglin variants.

**20w21a**
- Currently, piglins can ride any mob that is inside a boat. This therefore allows for many variants of normally unobtainable piglin jockeys. Having a piglin ride one of these mobs in the overworld or end and storing them in unloaded chunks until later can allow for zombified piglins riding many mobs in the future.

**1.16-Prerelease 6**
- Piglins can now spawn wearing enchanted golden armor, holding enchanted golden swords, and holding enchanted crossbows. Each bastion remnant visited with the world open, adds another layer of enchantments to the equipment held and worn by piglins in bastions. This allows for a wide variety of discontinued enchantment configurations, including conflicting and duplicate enchantments. Duplicate enchantments will be deleted in future versions, but the conflicting enchantments will be preserved.

**20w27a**
- Added Piglin Brutes, which spawn in bastions. Using a dispenser, piglin brutes can be equipped with armor, which will not be allowed in future versions.

**1.16.2-Prerelease 1**
- Zombie villagers can be converted to regular villagers while riding a chicken. They will then not dismount the chicken, allowing for a villager riding a chicken, which is not normally obtainable. The villager can be rezombified, also allowing for adult zombie villagers riding chickens. This same change also allows for piglins riding any mobs to zombify, and thus allows for zombified piglins riding any mob on a boat from earlier versions.

**21w03a**
- In 21w03a, Shulkers were changed such that when they entered a minecart, they would immediately reorient themselves right-side up and parallel to the block grid, meaning that any shulkers put in minecarts before then will keep their previous orientations but not display them when upgraded. the rotation is not limited to just the 6 normal rotations an attached shulker can have, but is very free as shulkers before 21w03a would rotate to follow the facing direction of a minecart they are in, which would be kept on updating.

**21w05a**
- Freezing a Skeleton On a Skeleton Horse or a spider will cause the skeleton to convert to a stray allowing for a Stray Skeleton Horsemen or a Stray Spider Jockey

**21w15a**
- Any entity that receives the glowing effect through either a spectral arrow or from a creeper explosion lingering cloud of glowing will become permanately glowing and the glowing tag will be set to 1b.
- Currently, zombie variants can hold glow ink sacs. This will not be possible in future versions, allowing for several discontinued zombie varieties.

**21w16a**
- Endermen can currently pick up both azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves. Endermen holding azalea leaves will not be obtainable in future versions.

**21w13a**
- Endermen can currently pick up both azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves. Endermen holding azalea leaves will not be obtainable in future versions.
- By downgrading withers that have the glowing effect from 1.17-pre1 will allow them to become permanetely glowing as the glowing tag will be set to 1b

**22w13oneBlockAtATime**
- The ender dragon can be brought into the overworld by flying it below Y-32 in the end
- Endermen can also spawn holding "generic_item_block"s, allowing for every item not normally obtainable, including spawn eggs, debug stick, knowledge book, and command block minecart
- Endermen spawn in holding any random block with varying blockstates, allowing for hundreds of discontinued endermen variations. Endermen can also spawn holding blocks that lack item forms, for example air variants and bubble columns.
- All Entities can be stacked, allowing for numerous variations of stacked entities and entities in boats
- Blocks can be placed directly into a minecart allowing for minecarts with custom display states. There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game. Placing a normal item into a minecart will convert into a minecart with the custom display state of air.
- The ender dragon can be ridden, allowing for a player on top of dragon jockey setup
- Any mob except for ender dragons can wear carved pumpkins or barrels in the helmet slot by throwing carved pumpkins or barrels onto the head of the entity.
- Zombie and skeleton horses can be tamed. This involves being in multiplayer, one player then picks up the other player and throws them onto a zombie horse. This can be repeated multiple times until the zombie horse is tamed.
- Any block can be converted to a falling entity by using a dropper, or by throwing a block. These can be stored by dropping them onto block 36.  There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game.
- End crystal entities can be placed above and below the build limits by picking up end crystal entities and dropping them in the air at these points
- In 22w13oneBlockAtATime villagers have new trades including trading for blocks and entities, loading these trades outside of this snapshot turns them into air trades. This can be circumvented by updating a zombie villager with the trades instead of a villager. Curing or updating to 24w09a or later deletes the trades.

**22w14a**
- Allays can have armor dispensed onto them after being given an item, allowing for armored allays, which will likely be discontinued in future versions. This also allows for the killed by allay statistic by having another player equip them with thorns armor, which will likely be future discontinued.
- Allays spawned in this version will have a higher generic movement speed than allays in newer versions

**22w24a**
- Allays can be duplicated while handing them an amethyst shard while they are dancing to a jukebox. Allays updated from earlier versions will have the CanDuplicate tag set to 0, allowing for discontinued allay variants

**22w43a**
- Dropping an anvil onto a fireball and then having it land inside a moving piston, it will create a fireball that has that anvil as the owner. This fireball can be made stationary by pushing it with a piston into a cobweb to preserve it.

**22w44a**
- Spawner minecarts will now be one of two varieties depending on the update path taken. For an empty spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in 13w06a through 15w31d, then kept unloaded until 1.11, then kept unloaded again until this version. For a pig spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in one of the versions of 1.13 or later. This snapshot technically creates a discontinued feature as a result of this split of spawner minecarts.
- Mobs with canpickuploot can wear armor, however they now will also pick up armor, even if it replaces a weapon. Normally a weapon takes precedence over armor for held items, meaning mobs that always spawn holding a weapon holding armor instead are discontinued. The discontinued mob variants holding armor are skeletons, strays, wither skeletons, piglins, and zombified piglins.

**1.19.3-Prerelease 1**

**23w13a_or_b**
- Added a vote to give a random entity a percent chance of dropping their respective spawn egg. This allows for every spawn egg to be obtained.
- Added a vote that changes the emerald in villager trades to a random item. These trades can be stacked on top of normal villager trades, allowing for an insane amount of discontinued villager combinations. Updating trades of items added in this version also allows for air trades as they get deleted in future versions. Note these air trades also get removed in future versions.
- Voting for midas touch and then touching mobs will turn them into gold. This turns the mob noAI and silent and applies for every mob (except sniffers because they crash).
- Added a vote that allows Endermen to pick up nearly any non tile entity block. This allows for numerous variants of discontinued endermen.
- The vote to replace villager trades also allows for usually discontinued no nbt items, including blank enchanted books, empty written books, no nbt suspicious stew and bee nests
- Using a map on the moon creates a map with dimension data of the moon, which is not normally obtainable

**1.20.2-Prerelease 1**
- Taiga armorer villagers now buy armor, however they only buy armor with full durability. This will be changed in the future so taiga armors will buy armor regardless of durability, making this a discontinued variant of villager.

**23w45a**
- Trial spawners can now generate spawning skeletons holding posionous arrows. This will be changed to only have bogged in the future. This allows for a discontinued trial spawner variant, and a discontinued skeleton variant.
- Using a horse spawn egg on a baby zombie trial spawner causes the spawning horses to have default statistics, giving them discontinued stats of jump and speed, as well as high health

**24w05a**
- Updating horses wearing horse armor into this version causes the armor to be duplicated, and also remain within the ArmorItems tag. Normally horses cannot have anything equipped in these slots.

**24w07a**
- The trial spawners that used to spawn skeletons holding poison arrows now spawn bogged, discontinuing the older variant of trial spawners. These trial spawners for bogged will have their simultaneous mobs added and loot distribution changed in future versions, making these a new discontinued variant of trial spawner themselves.

**24w09a**
- Updating old cleric villagers from 13w36a that have the empty enchantment trades will remove this tag, instead causing these villagers to become a variant of cleric selling completely unenchanted armor. This is a distinctly different variant of discontinued villager trade, as in future versions this tag will instead be converted to enchantment_glint_override.

> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Bundle datapack. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Giants spawn from the final phase of the mega spud boss battle, making giants obtainable
- All villagers and wandering traders currently replace emeralds that they would sell with poisonous potatoes, and emeralds that they would buy with amber gems. Updating out will delete the amber gem trades, making these variants of villagers that have invalid trade amounts and poisonous potato sell slots.
- Mobs spawned during the mega spud boss battle all have persistence required:1b. This allows for chickens, armadillos, creepers, ghasts, and giants to all generate with persistence_required:1b, all of which are discontinued variants of these mobs.
- The spiders spawned during the mega spud boss battle can be skeleton jockeys, allowing for spider jockeys to be in the end after teleporting the mega spud to the end. Normally jockeys cannot travel through portals, meaning these are mobs in an invalid dimension.
- Giants have AI in this version, allowing for the player to get a killed by giant statistic
- After transporting the Mega Spud to the overworld using the potato portal you can have it throw its fireball which has ExplosionPower:2b in the world, this is the only way of getting power 2b fireballs at the moment. 

**24w13a**
> [!Note]
> In order to get librarians trading the new enchanted books, the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack has to be disabled, and to load this world out of the april fools version, both of which can be performed through world save insertion. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21 and the Bundle datapack, and then toggle the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack to off. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files. This same process can be repeated to reenable the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack.
- Using a spawn egg on an ominous spawner causes the resulting mob to spawn with armor, even if this mob could not normally wear armor. This allows essentially all mobs wearing armor, and thus many discontinued mobs This additionally allows for all mobs to become dual wielding through using a spawn egg on trial spawners that spawn skeletons holding poisonous arrows.
- If the villager trade rebalance datapack is toggled off, all librarian villagers regardless of biome can sell enchanted books with the new enchantment. These enchantments will not be sold by villagers in future versions, making these discontinued trades.

**1.20.5-Prerelease 1**
- Mobs that wear equipment that spawn from ominous trial spawners can now wear enchanted armor and hold enchanted weapons. The protection types on this armor are not properly mutually exclusive, allowing for mobs wearing invalid protection armor.


**24w19a**
- Dispensing wolf armor onto villagers allows them to wear the wolf armor, and by having a canpickuploot:1b mob pick up either horse armor or wolf armor, they can also equip it

**24w20a**
- Wolf armor can be dispensed onto villagers, who will hold the wolf armor. By removing them from the line of sight of a player they will hold this wolf armor, creating a villager holding an invalid item.

**24w33a**
- Tridents and arrows now get stuck in the world border. These projectiles in the world border will be discontinued in future versions.

**24w36a**
- Mob loot tables are improperly preserved when mobs are converted. This allow several mobs to have invalid loot tables.
- Mob attributes are improperly preserved when mobs are converted. This allow for villagers, witches, and zombified piglins to have invalid speeds.
- Curing zombie villagers that have canpickuploot:0b preserves this tag on villagers, allowing for villagers to have canpickuploot:0b. These villagers are observable as they cannot pickup food and thus cannot replant.
- Villagers wearing armor that get struck by lightning convert to witches that have extra armor protection, but lose their armor, leading to mismatched attributes
- Leashing a pig and letting it get struck by lightning will convert to a Zombie Pigman with a leash on it.

**24w45a - 24w46a (Upgrading)**
- By going to snapshot 24w45a and throwing a bow to a Wither Skeleton with PickUpLoot true it will pick it up. Then by updating to 24w46a renaming a Totem of Undying to anything with an anvil and throwing that to the skeleton it will switch to holding that. From there its possible to damage the wither skeleton enough to pop the totem thus creating a Wither Skeleton holding no items

**1.21.2-Prerelease 3**
- Zombie villagers can be converted to regular villagers while riding a chicken. They will then not dismount the chicken, allowing for a villager riding a chicken, which is not normally obtainable. The villager can be rezombified, also allowing for adult zombie villagers riding chickens. The villager can also now be struck by lightning, allowing for witches riding chickens.


**25w14craftmine**
- In the April Fools snapshot 25w14craftmine, you can get some mobs with permanent glowing effect: Endermen, Silverfish, Baby Zombie, Skeleton, Wither Skeleton, Baby Drowned, and Vexes. To get them out of the snapshot, you and the mob will have to get on the coordinates 0, 0 in a boat and do WSI (World Save Insertion). Upon entering the world you'll spawn at coordinates 0, 0 in the Overworld. If you don't follow the coordinates you may fall into the void.
- In the Warden special event 32 villagers with NoAI: 1b, Invulnerable: 1b and Silent: 1b spawn as part of the audience. They can be turned into witches, which will result in NoAI, invulnerable, and silent Witches
- Baby zombies spawned during "Small but Deadly" mine, will always drop their helmets upon death. Those that have CanPickUpLoot:0b - are discontinued, as that behavior cannot be recreated in normal gameplay.
- In 25w14craftmine placing a lodestone next to an uneployed villager turns them into a traitor, a new profession. Downgrading out of this version deletes their profession (they retain their level) and all trades which include april fools' items. A Traitor's trades are: Novice: 8 Coal for 1 Emerald, Apprentice: 4 Iron Ingots for 1 Emerald, Journeyman: 8 Redstone Dust for 1 Emerald, Expert: 1 Diamond for 1 Emerald. Placing a new job site block next to these villagers makes them change their profession and replaces all their trades with ones from their new profession. The career level however is retained, and the new trades are based on the career level. Meaning that if the traitor was an apprentice the villager will be missing their novice trades and if it was a master the villager will be missing all their trades from expert and below.
- In 25w14craftmine you can get the illusioner to spawn naturally in a mine via having the illusioner mine ingredient in it, but they're pretty rare to spawn

**25w34a**
- Explosions reduce acceleration power of nearby projectiles by half, this allows for wind charges with acceleration power of 0.05, 0.025, 0.0125 and so on. Normally wind charges have acceleration of 0, but redirecting them via punching or hitting them with a projectile sets it to 0.1, which can then be halved any number of times. Note that only wind charges with acceleration power other than 0 or 0.1 are discontinued as other projectiles can still have their acceleration power reduced by bouncing them off of a breeze
