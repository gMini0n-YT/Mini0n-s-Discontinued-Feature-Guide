**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 1**
- Jumping will give you XP, this is not an unobtainable but it is a debug feature that can be used to get insane amount of Xp levels really quickly

**13w36a-1**
- Statistics do not track data values. This means that when crafting any color dye, it increases the statistic for ink sacs. The ink sac crafted statistic will be unobtainable in future verions.
- Items and blocks that are normally unobtainable can have various statistics associated with them, allowing for discontinued statistics by extension. Examples include bedrock placed. There is also the special case of command blocks placed. In future versions command blocks will no longer be able to be placed in survival, meaning that the statistic is both discontinued by block type and by statistic value.

**15w33a**
- Added items picked up and items dropped statistics. These can go negative by simply dropping or picking up negative stacks of items.

**19w36a**
- This version introduced new gamerules. These included drowningDamage, fallDamage, fireDamage, and doInsomnia. These rules are normally defaulted to true, however updating your world to this version causes them to be set to false, which allows for 4 discontinued gamestates. These cause the player to take no drowning, fire, or fall damage. This also prevents phantoms from spawning, causing phantoms to become a discontinued feature. Phantom membranes are still obtainable through cats.

> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Giants, illusioners, and zombie horses are all normally unobtainable mobs obtainable in this version. These mobs can all be killed by the player, and illusioners can kill the player, allowing for a variety of discontinued statistics.
- In several dimensions, including the "~N" dimension, structure voids generate. These structure voids can be mined, and will increase the structure void mined statistic. This statistic is normally not obtainable.

**22w13oneBlockAtATime**
- Currently throwing or placing any block increases the use statistic. This allows for the use statistic to increase for several items that normally cannot be placed in survival. This includes structure blocks, jigsaws, command blocks, repeating command blocks, and chain command blocks.
- Currently throwing or placing any item increases the use statistic. This allows for the use statistic to increase for several items that normally cannot be used in survival. This includes items such as diamonds and heart of the sea.
- When updating into this version while wearing an elytra, it will break when attempting to fly, allowing for the broken elytra statistic to increase

**23w13a_or_b**
- Dupe hack items can be crafted with any other item in the crafting interface to duplicate the item. This allows for crafting outputs of any item, and thus crafting statistics for every single item, even items not normally craftable.
- Votes that change crafting output and villager emeralds allow for the player to obtain any item through crafting, and thus acheive crafting statistics for any item.

**24w14potato-1**
> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Bundle datapack. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Giants have AI in this version, allowing for the player to get a killed by giant statistic
- Poisonous potatoes can be crafted into poisonous potato blocks. These blocks can then be crafted back into poisonous potatoes, allowing for a poisonous potato crafted statistic.  Poisonous potatoes can also be bought from villagers, also allowing the poisonous potato crafted statistic to increase.

**24w36a**
- Horse armor can be combined with other horse armor in a crafting table to repair it, which is normally not possible. This allows for a crafting statistic for diamond, gold, and iron horse armor by repairing them in a crafting table, which is normally not an obtainable statistic.
- Taking damage while wearing an elytra decreases the durability of the elytra, eventually breaking it and increasing the broken elytra statistic

**25w14craftmine**
- When loading into a raid special event the player is given bad omen with a duration of -1. It normally turns into raid omen right away due to the player always (at least in my testing) spawning inside a village, this can be avoided by quickly logging out and downgrading from this version. The bad omen will also show particles, which bad omen typically does not.
- In 25w14craftmine, Any frog can "devoure" you in a mine that has the "Wednesday frog" challenge ingredient, that saves it as a "frog killed you" statistic
- Many of the player unlocks in 25w14craftmine achieve their effects by giving the player an attribute modifier, which are not removed when updating out of this version (unless their attribute exists only in 25w14craftmine).
-  When inside a mine with the One HP mine ingredient the player is given an attribute modifier that reduces max health by 19. The modifier is cleared upon leaving the mine, but it can be preserved by updating out of 25w14craftmine without leaving the mine.
-  Using a mine revisitor to visit an old mine sets the player's game mode to adventure. Dying in a mine in multiplayer sets the player's game mode to spectator. These game modes can be preserved by logging off and updating out of craftmine.
