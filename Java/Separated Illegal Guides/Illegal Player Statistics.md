_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 1**
- Jumping will give you XP, this is not an unobtainable but it is a debug feature that can be used to get insane amount of Xp levels really quickly

**13w36a-1**
- Statistics do not track data values. This means that when crafting any color dye, it increases the statistic for ink sacs. The ink sac crafted statistic will be unobtainable in future verions.
- Items and blocks that are normally unobtainable can have various statistics associated with them, allowing for discontinued statistics by extension. Examples include bedrock placed. There is also the special case of command blocks placed. In future versions command blocks will no longer be able to be placed in survival, meaning that the statistic is both discontinued by block type and by statistic value.

**15w33a**
- Added items picked up and items dropped statistics. These can go negative by simply dropping or picking up negative stacks of items.

**19w36a**
- This version introduced new gamerules. These included drowningDamage, fallDamage, fireDamage, and doInsomnia. These rules are normally defaulted to true, however updating your world to this version causes them to be set to false, which allows for 4 discontinued gamestates. These cause the player to take no drowning, fire, or fall damage. This also prevents phantoms from spawning, causing phantoms to become a discontinued feature. Phantom membranes are still obtainable through cats.

**20w14âˆž**
> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Giants, illusioners, and zombie horses are all normally unobtainable mobs obtainable in this version. These mobs can all be killed by the player, and illusioners can kill the player, allowing for a variety of discontinued statistics.
- In several dimensions, including the "~N" dimension, structure voids generate. These structure voids can be mined, and will increase the structure void mined statistic. This statistic is normally not obtainable.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**20w14a - 20w13b (Downgrading)**
- By downgrading a warped fungus on a stick from the previous version, negative durability warped fungus on a stick can be created. This works by taking at least two warped fungi on a stick in the previous version, and getting the durability lower than roughly 70 at least. The lower the durability, the easier to combine. Once these low durability warped fungi on a stick are obtained, they can be downgraded to this version and combined in a crafting table. This will make the warped fungus on a stick receive a lower durability, and can consistently be combined to as low as roughly -2 billion durability. Anything lower than roughly -125 durability will remain negative when updated.

**20w15a**
- Piglins now avoid soul campfires, however baby piglins can still pick up soul campfires. These baby piglins holding soul campfires will not be obtainable in future versions.

**20w16a**
- Currently specific bastion structures generate with a single barrier block. Barrier blocks are normally not obtainable.
- Piglins and hoglins that generate in bastions have a speed level much higher than normally obtainable

**20w17a**
- Piglins that are holding a crossbow will drop their crossbow to pick up golden items. Normally a piglin needs to be holding a weapon, thus allowing for discontinued piglin variants.

**20w21a**
- Currently, piglins can ride any mob that is inside a boat. This therefore allows for many variants of normally unobtainable piglin jockeys. Having a piglin ride one of these mobs in the overworld or end and storing them in unloaded chunks until later can allow for zombified piglins riding many mobs in the future.

**1.16-Prerelease 6**
- Piglins can now spawn wearing enchanted golden armor, holding enchanted golden swords, and holding enchanted crossbows. Each bastion remnant visited with the world open, adds another layer of enchantments to the equipment held and worn by piglins in bastions. This allows for a wide variety of discontinued enchantment configurations, including conflicting and duplicate enchantments. Duplicate enchantments will be deleted in future versions, but the conflicting enchantments will be preserved.

**20w27a**
- Added Piglin Brutes, which spawn in bastions. Using a dispenser, piglin brutes can be equipped with armor, which will not be allowed in future versions.

**1.16.2-Prerelease 1**
- Zombie villagers can be converted to regular villagers while riding a chicken. They will then not dismount the chicken, allowing for a villager riding a chicken, which is not normally obtainable. The villager can be rezombified, also allowing for adult zombie villagers riding chickens. This same change also allows for piglins riding any mobs to zombify, and thus allows for zombified piglins riding any mob on a boat from earlier versions.

**Combat Test 7a**
- Potions stack to 16, allowing for all potion varieties to be overstacked

**1.16.3 Release Candidate 1**
- Updating overstacked potions from the previous combat test versions allows you to combine the stacks of 16 into larger stacks, allowing for all potions stacked to 64

**20w45a**
- Bundles currently only stack to one, however 16 bundles can be picked up within a bundle, allowing for overstacked bundles
- Using bundles within the crafting interface allows for certain items to be overstacked. The method requires putting stacked items into a crafting recipe, and then using a bundle to remove one of the ingredients. This doesn't update the output, so taking the output increases the stack size of all remaining ingredients in the crafting grid. This allows for overstacked honey bottles, and overstacked banners and shields.
- Currently 64 bee nests can be placed inside a bundle regardless of nbt data. In future versions, bee nests with nbt data related to bees will only be able to stack to 1 in a bundle, allowing for overstacked bee nests in bundles.
- Using a firecharge from a dispenser, waterlogged candles can be lit
- Added Amethyst Geodes, which generate in a globe shape consisting of amethyst blocks, usually buried in the ground. Currently, geodes can generate higher than Y 30, however this will be changed in future versions. This makes any budding amethyst blocks above Y 30 currently unobtainable.
- Smelting Copper Ore will add the recipe tag of "minecraft:copper_ingot" on a furnace, and a recipe tag of "minecraft:copper_ingot_from_blasting" on a blast furnace, both of which will be changed in future versions. This stored recipe is completely unobservable, and will be removed if an item is ever taken out of the furnace/blast furnace output slot manually, however hoppers can be used to remove items from the output slot and stack multiple recipes.

**20w48a**
- By emptying a bundle in the inventory, an empty item tag is created. This empty tag is normally not obtainable.

**21w03a**
- Placing glow lichen into lava in the nether causes it to waterlog, allowing for water in the nether

**21w15a**
- Any entity that receives the glowing effect through either a spectral arrow or from a creeper explosion lingering cloud of glowing will become permanately glowing and the glowing tag will be set to 1b.
- Salmon buckets now store salmon health. This creates another variant of salmon buckets without size information saved, which will be discontinued in future versions.
- Currently, zombie variants can hold glow ink sacs. This will not be possible in future versions, allowing for several discontinued zombie varieties.

**21w16a**
- Endermen can currently pick up both azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves. Endermen holding azalea leaves will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves can be used to craft suspicious stew with no effect. This will not be obtainable in future versions.

**21w19a**
- Any bundles with multiple bee nests with nbt will now become bundles with too many items. By right clicking on these bundles with any item, the item can be overstacked and duplicated, allowing for every item in the game to be overstacked in this version.
- By overstacking items inside the bundle, items can be left clicked onto the bundle, and it creates item slots with air and a negative count, however it does also copy the nbt creating bundles full of nbt. Using these nbt bundles with large amounts of nbt data, for example chunk savestating books, can be used to overfill a chunk and perform both chunk savestating and chunk regeneration, which will be further utilized in later versions.
- Obtaining a large bundle and attempting to save, and crashing the game at a precise time during this save can create a level#############.dat file, which is a file discontinued feature will not be obtainable in future versions. Similarly, by performing this crash while attempting to save a chunk containing more data than allocated ram, a tmp###################.tmp can be created in the region folder, which is another file discontinued feature that will not be obtainable in future versions.

**1.17.1 - 21w05a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Deepslate, Chiseled Deepslate, Polished Deepslate, Deepslate Tiles, Cracked Deepslate Tiles, Deepslate Bricks, Cracked Deepslate Bricks, Cobbled Deepslate, Deepslate Lapis Lazuli Ore, Deepslate Redstone Ore, Deepslate Diamond Ore, Deepslate Emerald Ore, Deepslate Gold Ore, Deepslate Iron Ore, Deepslate Copper Ore, Deepslate Coal Ore, Infested Deepslate, Smooth Basalt, Waxed Variants for Oxidized Copper Variants, Raw Iron, Raw Copper, Raw Gold, Raw Iron Blocks, Raw Copper Blocks, Raw Gold Blocks, and any Deepslate Variants of Walls, Stairs, or Slabs will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items.

**21w05a - 21w03a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing  Azaleas, Azalea Leaves, Flowering Azalea Leaves, Cave Vines, Glowberries, Big Dripleaf, Small Dripleaf, Hanging Roots, Moss Blocks, Moss Carpets, and Rooted Dirt will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (192 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**21w03a - 20w51a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Glow Lichen, Glow Ink Sacs, and Glow Item Frames will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (256 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w51a - 20w48a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Bucket of Axolotl will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the item will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include this item. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (320 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w48a - 20w46a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading bundles containing Dripstone Blocks and Pointed Dripstone will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the items will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include these items. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (384 if stacked with the previous bundle).

**20w45a (Datapack)**
> [!Note]
> This version requires a Caves & Cliffs Datapack. The 21w15a Caves & Cliffs Datapack can be downloaded from the "Mods & Extra Files" folder. From here, the zip folder can directly be placed into the datapacks folder within the world save folder.
- Downgrading bundles containing a Powdered Snow Bucket will cause the bundles to maintain the item tags, however the item will visually disappear, and cause the count to not include this item. This allows for additional items to be placed within the bundle, increasing the amount to 128 total items (448 if stacked with the previous bundle). It is recommended to combine this with 64 unique bee nests within the bundle for the maximum bundle size.

**21w05b (Datapack)**
> [!Note]
> This version requires the same Caves & Cliffs Datapack from the previous version, meaning no file editing is required if updating from the previous version
- The world height is now increased to 320, and extends below to -64. Any new chunks generated in this version with the datapack will have solid stone generate underneath all chunks extending down from Y0 to Y-64, with no bedrock.

**21w13a**
- Endermen can currently pick up both azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves. Endermen holding azalea leaves will not be obtainable in future versions.
- Azalea leaves and flowering azalea leaves can be used to craft suspicious stew with no effect. This will not be obtainable in future versions.
- By downgrading withers that have the glowing effect from 1.17-pre1 will allow them to become permanetely glowing as the glowing tag will be set to 1b

**1.18-Exp 1**
> [!Note]
> This version does not use a datapack and requires world save insertion to use. First, the datapack can be removed from the world save, and then the world save can be removed from the saves folder. From here, go to the create a world screen and set the name to the name of the world save folder. Then drag the world save back into the saves folder, and select create world. This will force load the world in this version.
- All biomes are now height dependent. This allows for the same X and Z location to have a different biome on Y level. This is also the case in future versions, however currently the generation of these Y level biomes continue past normal biome boundaries, allowing for invalid biome variants dependent on Y level.

**1.18-Exp 2**
> [!Note]
> This version does not use a datapack and requires world save insertion to use. First, the datapack can be removed from the world save, and then the world save can be removed from the saves folder. From here, go to the create a world screen and set the name to the name of the world save folder. Then drag the world save back into the saves folder, and select create world. This will force load the world in this version.
- Added a CustomeSpawnRules tag to spawners, which determines the light level of which mobs can spawn. Currently, all old spawners have the value set to 0, which is not obtainable normally. Updating these spawners to later versions converts them to pig spawners, which are not normally obtainable.

**1.18-Exp 7**
- Elytra no longer take damage when gliding. Elytra take exactly three damage each time a firework rocket is used. Elytra can now break when reaching 0 durability. This allows for the elytra broken statistic to increase. This statistic can not normally increase, due to elytra never breaking.

**21w39a - 21w37a (Downgrading)**
- Currently washing a banner in a cauldron cause it to retain the id tag while losing all of the patterns, creating a blank banner with an unnecessary nbt tag. By placing and breaking this banner it will change the tag to be an empty pattern tag. These are two variants of banners that will be discontinued in future versions.

**1.19-Exp 1**
> [!Note]]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Added the swift sneak enchantment, which currently can be applied to boots. This enchantment will be a leggings exclusive enchantment in future versions, making swift sneak enchanted boots unobtainable.
- Reinforced Deepslate can currently be pushed by pistons, allowing for reinforced deepslate in any position in the overworld and allowing it be stored in block 36 form, both of which will be discontinued when the block is recontinued.

**22w13oneBlockAtATime**
- The ender dragon can be brought into the overworld by flying it below Y-32 in the end
- Various items can be obtained in this version that are not normally obtainable. Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Petrified Oak Slabs, and End Portal Frames can all be obtained either through an enderman handing them to the player, and then storing them in a donkey or storing them as a falling entity, which is then dropped onto a torch in the following version. Storing them as an item will maintain the blockstate tag, whereas storing them as an entity will drop them without any nbt data. End portal frames also generate naturally in nether fortress loot table chests.
- Endermen can also spawn holding "generic_item_block"s, allowing for every item not normally obtainable, including spawn eggs, debug stick, knowledge book, and command block minecart
- Endermen spawn in holding any random block with varying blockstates, allowing for hundreds of discontinued endermen variations. Endermen can also spawn holding blocks that lack item forms, for example air variants and bubble columns.
- End Gateways can be obtained in both the nether and end, as enderman can spawn holding these blocks, and the player can pick up these blocks and place them in other dimensions. Similarly, nether portals can be obtained in the end through this same method.
- Every arrangement of an invalid blockstate is theoretically obtainable, as endermen can spawn with blocks with any blockstate, which can then be placed. Several examples are only possible through this method, such as waterlogged soul campfires, all direction false vines, and waterlogged double slabs.
- All Entities can be stacked, allowing for numerous variations of stacked entities and entities in boats
- Blocks can be placed directly into a minecart allowing for minecarts with custom display states. There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game. Placing a normal item into a minecart will convert into a minecart with the custom display state of air.
- The ender dragon can be ridden, allowing for a player on top of dragon jockey setup
- Any mob except for ender dragons can wear carved pumpkins or barrels in the helmet slot by throwing carved pumpkins or barrels onto the head of the entity.
- Zombie and skeleton horses can be tamed. This involves being in multiplayer, one player then picks up the other player and throws them onto a zombie horse. This can be repeated multiple times until the zombie horse is tamed.
- Any block can be converted to a falling entity by using a dropper, or by throwing a block. These can be stored by dropping them onto block 36.  There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game.
- Picking up blocks allows for items with the blockstate tag. Blocks that do not normally store a blockstate will have an empty blockstate tag, and all blocks that normally have a blockstate can have numerous blockstate tags. Certain blockstate tags, such as "waterlogged:true" can only be obtained when handed to the player by an enderman, which can occur by angering an enderman and letting it hit the player.
- Water in the nether can be obtained either through placing a block with a waterlogged blockstate, or by throwing blocks such as seagrass in the nether.
- End crystal entities can be placed above and below the build limits by picking up end crystal entities and dropping them in the air at these points
- Droppers and dispensers do not have block entities in this version, allowing them to be pushed by pistons and allowing for droppers and dispensers to be stored in block 36 form
- Currently throwing or placing any block increases the use statistic. This allows for the use statistic to increase for several items that normally cannot be placed in survival. This includes structure blocks, jigsaws, command blocks, repeating command blocks, and chain command blocks.
- Currently throwing or placing any item increases the use statistic. This allows for the use statistic to increase for several items that normally cannot be used in survival. This includes items such as diamonds and heart of the sea.
- When updating into this version while wearing an elytra, it will break when attempting to fly, allowing for the broken elytra statistic to increase

**22w14a**
- Allays can have armor dispensed onto them after being given an item, allowing for armored allays, which will likely be discontinued in future versions. This also allows for the killed by allay statistic by having another player equip them with thorns armor, which will likely be future discontinued.
- Added Recovery Compasses, which point to the location where the player last died. Currently, by having exactly two recovery compasses in a stack, and clicking both of them on a lodestone, one will become a recovery compass with lodestone tags, which will be discontinued in the next version.
- Recovery compasses can be used on a lodestone, which increases the recovery compass used statistic, which will be discontinued in future versions
- Currently growing a mangrove tree doesn't update blocks around it, allowing for many discontinued mangrove tree arrangements, such as a mangrove root on snowy grass

**22w17a**
- The player receives a new uuid in this version, allowing for pets to have an invalid owner id, and for multiple statistic and advancement files

**22w24a**
- Allays can be duplicated while handing them an amethyst shard while they are dancing to a jukebox. Allays updated from earlier versions will have the CanDuplicate tag set to 0, allowing for discontinued allay variants

**22w43a**
- Placing a birch wall sign on the side of a block and placing a note block above it sets the note block instrument to snare. In future versions this instrument will be bass, making this a discontinued note block variant.
- Dropping an anvil onto a fireball and then having it land inside a moving piston, it will create a fireball that has that anvil as the owner. This fireball can be made stationary by pushing it with a piston into a cobweb to preserve it.

**22w44a**
- Spawner minecarts will now be one of two varieties depending on the update path taken. For an empty spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in 13w06a through 15w31d, then kept unloaded until 1.11, then kept unloaded again until this version. For a pig spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in one of the versions of 1.13 or later. This snapshot technically creates a discontinued feature as a result of this split of spawner minecarts.
- Mobs with canpickuploot can wear armor, however they now will also pick up armor, even if it replaces a weapon. Normally a weapon takes precedence over armor for held items, meaning mobs that always spawn holding a weapon holding armor instead are discontinued. The discontinued mob variants holding armor are skeletons, strays, wither skeletons, piglins, and zombified piglins.

**22w45a**
- Currently trying to place a book into a full chiseled bookshelf duplicates the book and increases the stack size. This allows for overstacked enchanted books, book and quills, and written books, and is the first overstacking method for any enchanted book with swift sneak

**22w46a**
- Added new noteblock instruments in the form of mob sounds. By placing a mob head on a noteblock, the note block will now play the corresponding sound of the mob. This introduces discontinued noteblocks, as any noteblocks with mob heads on them from earlier versions will have the incorrect instrument.

**1.19.3-Prerelease 1**
- Tropical fish can spawn with the color black as both a base color and highlight color. Fish with black coloring are not supposed to spawn naturally, making these discontinued tropical fish variants.
- Added a "custom_head" instrument for player heads placed on noteblocks. There is currently not a sound associated with the head. Any player heads placed on noteblocks in earlier versions will have an incorrect instrument, thus creating a discontinued feature.

**23w05a**
- Potion effects can now be made infinite when the potion effect is set to a duration of -1. These infinite effects should normally be unobtainable, however by layering a lower level longer duration potion with the equivalent higher level shorter duration potion in a specific order, an infinite effect can be created.

**23w06a**
- Jack O' Lanterns can be placed on armor stands, which will not be allowed in future versions, and also picked up and worn by canpickuploot mobs. While mobs can wear Jack O' Lanterns on Halloween, these Jack O' Lanterns cannot have any custom nbt, such as curses or names, allowing for discontinued entity variants.

**23w07a**
- Suspicious sand is not supposed to be obtainable as an item. However, by dropping it into a bubble column, cobwebs, or the end portal, it still drops.
- Crafting decorated pots creates a shard list tag. In future versions this will be a sherd list tag, however updating these will maintain the shard tag creating discontinued pot variants. This tag is not visible.
- Placing decorated pots in water waterlogs them, however it does not properly update water, allowing for discontinued waterlogged decorated pot configurations.

**23w12a**
- Suspicious gravel is not supposed to be obtainable as an item. However, by dropping it into a bubble column, cobwebs, or the end portal, it still drops.
- Updating suspicious sand into this version regenerates any chunk where it is present, allowing for many discontinued block configurations
- Suspicious sand generates in trail ruins and has a trail ruin loot table. In future versions suspicious sand will be unable to generate with the trail ruin loot table.
- Pitcher crops can be planted on farmland, and will float when breaking the farmland below them. Floating pitcher pods are a discontinued block configuration.

**23w13a_or_b**
- The votes to replace any inventory item and replace any crafting output preserves the nbt of the item and transfers it to the new item. Pairing this with the nbt crafting allows for any nbt on any item, technically also allowing for any item through the use of container inventory. This works by getting a replace item to replace a compound tag with a container of some sort, which is incredibly rare when multiplying these odds together. This by extension also allows for no nbt on items that normally would have nbt, such as suspicious stews.
- Added votes that replace any inventory item, any crafting output, or any loot drop with a random item. These votes, along with the vote that replaces villager emeralds, allow for any item, including normally discontinued items. This includes Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Path Blocks, Petrified Oak Slabs, End Portal Frames, Frogspawn, Reinforced Deepslate, Suspicious Sand & Gravel, Spawn Eggs, Command Block Minecarts, Knowledge Books, and Debug Sticks.
- Added votes that will give a player a random item and allow a chicken to lay a random item instead of an egg. This allows for any item in the game, including Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Path Blocks, Petrified Oak Slabs, End Portal Frames, Frogspawn, Reinforced Deepslate, Suspicious Sand & Gravel, Spawn Eggs, Command Block Minecarts, Knowledge Books, and Debug Sticks.
- Added a vote that allows for fishing anything. This includes being able to fish discontinued items, such as Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Path Blocks, End Portal Frames, Frogspawn, Reinforced Deepslate, Suspicious Sand & Gravel, Spawn Eggs, Luck Potions and Arrows, Paintings with Type NBT, and Bucket of Fish without any NBT values
- Added vote rules to change the generated block from water touching lava or lava touching blue ice to a random block. This allows for normally unobtainable blocks to generate, including Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Light Blocks, Player Heads, and Petrified Oak Slabs, as well as normally obtainable blocks in unobtainable positions.
- Added a vote to double or halve the stack size of a random item. This allows for every item to be overstacked to 127, and stacks of 127 of every item in every container
- Dupe hack items can be crafted with any other item in the crafting table to duplicate the item. This allows for a stack of 2 of any item crafted with the dupe hack, which can then be combined further into larger stacks. This allows for every item to be overstacked to 64.
- Using the replace item in inventory vote to replace a stacked item with an unstackable item creates an overstacked item
- Added a vote to give a random entity a percent chance of dropping their respective spawn egg. This allows for every spawn egg to be obtained.
- Added a vote that allows player heads to drop from players killed by charged creepers. This allows for not only player heads, but also custom player heads with player data.
- Moon lab shulkers that generate in lunar bases can have unobtainable items as loot, including budding amethyst, cow spawn eggs, sheep spawn eggs, and villager spawn eggs
- Putting a normal stack of items in a bundle, and then voting to increase that item's stack size to greater than 64 makes the bundle behave as if it is empty, allowing another stack of items to be placed inside. This can be repeated indefinitely every time a stack size vote appears. Note that attempting to place items in a bundle while their stack size is set at above 64 will crash the game
- Added a vote that changes the emerald in villager trades to a random item. These trades can be stacked on top of normal villager trades, allowing for an insane amount of discontinued villager combinations. Updating trades of items added in this version also allows for air trades as they get deleted in future versions. Note these air trades also get removed in future versions.
- Drinking a bottle of void while having any potion effect duplicates the effect onto a potion under custom potion effects. This allows for numerous discontinued potion variants, including discontinued levels and durations, even allowing for infinite potion effects potions. Having players from older versions with invalid potion effects who rejoin while maintaining that potion effect in this version also allows these old potion effects to be preserved.
- Added a vote that gives every player an infinite random potion effect. This allows every infinite potion effect from level 1 through 6 on the player except for instant health and instant damage.
- Voting for midas touch and then touching mobs will turn them into gold. This turns the mob noAI and silent and applies for every mob (except sniffers because they crash).
- Added a vote that allows Endermen to pick up nearly any non tile entity block. This allows for numerous variants of discontinued endermen.
- Added vote rules to change nearly every gamerule value. This allows for discontinued values for every single gamerule (except specific command block related ones).
- Added a vote called the midas touch. This will convert every item in the player's inventory into golden equivalents, allowing for any nbt tag on golden ingots when paired with nbt crafting, as well as any normal nbt on various golden items. This also allows for negative durability on every piece of golden armor and tools.
- The replace crafting output vote allows for any item to replace the output of a furnace recipe. This allows for any item in the output slots of furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces.
- The potion of big is brewed from bottles of experience, and potions of small are brewed from rabbit hides. These items are not normally allowed in a brewing stand, creating two variants of discontinued items in brewing stands.
- Using a potion of big or small on a mob, and keeping the mob in unloaded chunks until 23w51a will allow the mob to retain the invalid generic.scale attribute, allowing for numerous variants of incorrectly sized mobs.
- Mining the dropper or chest from the lunar base drops the respective item with a custom translation string. Similarly, using a piston to break any of the shulker boxes generated in the lunar structure drops shulker boxes with custom translation strings and loot tables.
- The vote to replace villager trades also allows for usually discontinued no nbt items, including blank enchanted books, empty written books, no nbt suspicious stew and bee nests
- The votes that give a player a random item or allow a chicken to lay a random item instead of an egg will also give the player no nbt items. This allows for blank enchanted books, empty written books, no nbt suspicious stew and bee nests, and uncraftable potion variants, among other things.
- Big and small potions have custom potion effects of big and small, which upon updating will convert to uncraftable potions with these respective potion tags
- The place block can be used to place normally unplaceable blocks, such as command blocks
- Added a vote that makes all tnt that is placed unstable. Unstable tnt is normally unobtainable.
- Added a vote rule that disables all block updates. This allows for many discontinued block configurations.
- Pusing block entities does not properly update their states, allowing for invalid blocks such as half double chests and open barrels
- Added vote rules to change the generated block from water touching lava or lava touching blue ice to a random block. This allows for numerous discontinued block configurations as any block can generate in a position where water touches lava or lava touches blue ice.

> In order to play your world in this version with update 1.21 experimental features enabled, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Bundle datapack. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.

**23w51a**
- Crafting suspicious stews with a dandelion or a blue orchid creates a 7 second stew instead of a 7 tick stew, which are unobtainable variants. This also works to create discontinued mooshroom variants by feeding them the respective flowers.

**24w03a**
- Currently sword enchants can apply to axes and thorns can apply to non chestplate armor in the enchantment table, allowing for these items to have these enchantments without repair cost. Normally these enchantments on these respective items are only obtainable through an anvil, and thus will have repair cost.

These trial spawners for bogged will have their simultaneous mobs added and loot distribution changed in future versions, making these a new discontinued variant of trial spawner themselves.

**24w09a**
- Currently any chunks with overstacked items can be savestated, as attempting to save invalid item counts of items (or bundles with invalid items inside of them) causes the chunk to revert to it's last save. This allows for item and block duplication, and many discontinued block configurations.
- Grindstoning enchanted books adds the Damage:0 tag to the book, which is an invalid nbt tag.
- Updating old cleric villagers from 13w36a that have the empty enchantment trades will remove this tag, instead causing these villagers to become a variant of cleric selling completely unenchanted armor.

**24w10a**
- By placing two of the same items into the grindstone slots, the enchantments of the item in the bottom slot will be transferred to the item in the top slot. This only works for items that have durability, however it allows for all enchantments to be combined on a single item without repair cost, and many instances of incompatible enchantment combinations.
- Loading bee nest or beehive items with honey levels from 24w07a or before will convert the honey level tag to true or false instead of remaining a number. Since this value is supposed to be a number, this is a discontinued tag, and is also completely unobservable.

> In order to play your world in this version with the Winter Drop experimental features enabled, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Minecart Improvements, Redstone Experiments, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Winter Drop datapack.
