**Classic 0.0.14a_08**
- Sand and Gravel do not fall into liquids allowing for sand and gravel floating above water

**Classic 0.0.19a_04**
- Sponges would not update to a Wet Sponge when used, allowing for weird, unobtainable positions and states of water

**Classic 0.0.23a_01**
- By placing gravity blocks (sand or gravel) above a water source, the gravity block and the water will swap places, allowing for non-updated water sources.

**Indev 20100201-2**
- Sponges would soak up infinite lava and infinite water allowing for discontinued configurations of the water and lava

**Indev 20100209**
-  Any item can be placed in the furnace fuel and output slot

**Infdev 20100607**
- Top Half Doors can be created by placing two signs and placing a door on top

**Infdev 20100615**
- Water and Lava can flow next to each other without forming stone
- Lava will flow 8 blocks in the overworld which will later update to 3 blocks making it an illegal block formations
- Water and Lava do not update correctly, allowing for water and lava in different flow states without a source block

**Infdev 20100616-1**
- Holes in the Bedrock can generate when lava pools generate at the bottom of the world

**Infdev 20100617-2**
- The bottom most layer of the world is made of stone and bedrock allowing for holes within the bedrock

**Infdev 20100625-2**
- Spawners currently have the same block id as signs. If a sign is loaded near a spawner, the spawner will receive sign metadata. Reloading a sign-spawner will crash and potentially soft lock the world in this version. This is fixed in the next version, but the spawner maintains the sign data.

**Alpha 1.0.1_01 - Infdev 20100630-2**
- Downgrading Redstone that is placed on against a block will convert it to a gear in Infdev 20100630-2. Breaking the block below the gear and updating back to Alpha 1.0.1_01 will create floating redstone

**Alpha 1.0.1_01**
- Activating a lever and then breaking it's support block will keep the lever floating

**Alpha 1.0.4**
> [!Note]
> In order to access the winter mode type and obtain snow and ice, the level.dat will have to be regenerated. This will reset the player position and remove all items within the inventory, as well as changing the world seed. This can be done by deleting level.dat and level.dat_old, then going to the "singleplayer" screen, and selecting the world slot that has the same name as the world save folder. This will likely have to be done several times before the winter type is set to 1
- Snow Layers were added but can only be obtained in the Winter Type Map. Snow Layers would generate on top of all blocks during snowfall which allows for illegal block formations like snow layers on non-full blocks (e.g. stairs and slabs)

**Alpha 1.0.5-2**
- Added Block Replacement Bypass, this is involves placing a support blocks directly into water, lava, fire, or snow. This allows for many illegal block formations such as floating flowers, floating ladders, quintuple chests

**Alpha 1.0.6**
- Cactus can be placed on and next to any block allowing for many illegal block formations

**Alpha 1.0.11**
- Placing a door next to a cactus would create a half door

**Alpha 1.2.0**
- Lava only flows 4 blocks in the nether

**Alpha 1.2.2**
- Nether Portals can be summoned by pressing F4 which can be used to get to the Farlands and to create illegal block formations

**Beta 1.4-1** 
- Locked Chests can generate throughout the world if your computer time is set to April 1st, 2011. You can obtain them from explosions, they will convert to stained glass in the future allowing for several illegal block formations

**Beta 1.6-tb3**
- Melting Ice in the nether won't dissolve the water making it possible to have water in the nether
- Update Suppresion now works by using budding redstone updates, you can find the world download in the "Mods & Extra Files" Folder for the Update Suppresor Model for this version

**Beta 1.7**
- Block Transmutation can work by building a piston and water based contraption

**Beta 1.7.2**
- Block Transmutation can work by updating a budded piston at the same time another piston pushes a block merging the blocks

**Beta 1.8 Prerelease 1-1**
- Updating a furnace into a lit furnace which will update a piston and then pushing the furnace will displace it's block entity. This allows for furnace block entity in any block in the game that normally has a block entity

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 (MOD)**
> [!Note]
> This version uses a mod to assign a block id to a cauldron in order to access the original brewing system. The beta 1.9 pre2 cauldron mod can be downloaded from resources. The zip file can then be extracted, and the folder titled "enable" can be zipped. This enabled zip can then be added to a b1.9-pre2 instance in multimc by going to edit instance and add to minecraft.jar. You can find this mod in the "Mods & Extra Files" folder
- The cauldron currently uses the id of an enchantment table and the block data of a brewing stand. This means that updating out of this version will convert the cauldron to an enchantment table with the block data of a brewing stand

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4-1**
- Placing a support block on a glass block will misplace the support block somewhere where it can be placed, using this method you can place support blocks on chests which can give you unobtainable block formations

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6**
- The exit portal would generate when the ender dragon is killed but the exit portal would generate where the dragon died and not at 0,0 allowing for the exit end portal in discontinued locations
- Nether Portal can be placed in the end, allowing for nether portals in the end

**12w07a**
- The End in this version does not generate with any main end island it is just you and the void. Additionally when you kill the ender dragon the exit portal will spawn where the dragon died instead of at 0.0
