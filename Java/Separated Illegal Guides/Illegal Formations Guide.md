- By placing gravity blocks (sand or gravel) above a water source, the gravity block and the water will swap places, allowing for non-updated water sources.

**Indev 20100124-3**
- As chests were a full cube from Indev 0.31 20100124-2119 through Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5, many blocks requiring support could be placed against them. The action of "shift clicking" was not implemented in these versions, so to place the blocks onto the chest, they must be placed on a block next to them that cannot support them allowing for Support Blocks on chests

**Indev 20100201-2**
- Sponges would soak up infinite lava and infinite water allowing for discontinued configurations of the water and lava

**Indev 20100209**

- The bottom most layer of the world is made of stone and bedrock allowing for holes within the bedrock

**Infdev 20100625-2**
- Spawners currently have the same block id as signs. If a sign is loaded near a spawner, the spawner will receive sign metadata. Reloading a sign-spawner will crash and potentially soft lock the world in this version. This is fixed in the next version, but the spawner maintains the sign data.

**Alpha 1.0.1_01 - Infdev 20100630-2**
- Downgrading Redstone that is placed on against a block will convert it to a gear in Infdev 20100630-2. Breaking the block below the gear and updating back to Alpha 1.0.1_01 will create floating redstone

**Alpha 1.0.1_01**
- Activating a lever and then breaking it's support block will keep the lever floating

**Alpha 1.0.4**
> [!Note]
> In order to access the winter mode type and obtain snow and ice, the level.dat will have to be regenerated. This will reset the player position and remove all items within the inventory, as well as changing the world seed. This can be done by deleting level.dat and level.dat_old, then going to the "singleplayer" screen, and selecting the world slot that has the same name as the world save folder. This will likely have to be done several times before the winter type is set to 1
- Snow Layers were added but can only be obtained in the Winter Type Map. Snow Layers would generate on top of all blocks during snowfall which allows for illegal block formations like snow layers on non-full blocks (e.g. stairs and slabs)

**Alpha 1.0.5-2**

**Alpha 1.2.2**
- Nether Portals can be summoned by pressing F4 which can be used to get to the Farlands and to create illegal block formations
- Signs can be placed on the Nether Portal Tile

**Beta 1.3.2**
- Because the Chest is a full block you are able to power blocks through chests. The best way to so that is by the repeater

- Updating a furnace into a lit furnace which will update a piston and then pushing the furnace will displace it's block entity. This allows for furnace block entity in any block in the game that normally has a block entity
- Updating a Chest from Beta 1.7.3 will cause it to be a darkness block inside the chest because previously chests were opaque and a full block. Any block changes around the chest will break it.

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 (MOD)**
> [!Note]
> This version uses a mod to assign a block id to a cauldron in order to access the original brewing system. The beta 1.9 pre2 cauldron mod can be downloaded from resources. The zip file can then be extracted, and the folder titled "enable" can be zipped. This enabled zip can then be added to a b1.9-pre2 instance in multimc by going to edit instance and add to minecraft.jar. You can find this mod in the "Mods & Extra Files" folder
- The cauldron currently uses the id of an enchantment table and the block data of a brewing stand. This means that updating out of this version will convert the cauldron to an enchantment table with the block data of a brewing stand

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4-1**
- Placing a support block on a glass block will misplace the support block somewhere where it can be placed, using this method you can place support blocks on chests which can give you unobtainable block formations

- Horse saddles will convert to armor stands in future versions, allowing for a variety of discontinued features associted to armor stands, including armor stands in the furnace fuel slot and overstacked armor stands.

**13w36a-1**
- A method of block transmutation is now possible. This method works by firing an arrow, then pushing the arrow with a piston so it is floating, and then breaking the block it was previously on and replacing it with a golden pressure plate. This allows for several invalid data value blocks, and an easy form of update suppression by creating 6 sided pistons

**13w37a**
- Chunk regeneration can occur by mining a powered redstone lamp with silk touch. This allows for an assortment of unobtainable block configurations.

**1.7.10 Build 20 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- Command computers can be used to run any command in the game. This is different to the teachers menu in that this can be acheived by a non op player by using the command computer datapack linked in "Mods & Extra Files". It can also be obtained in survival without using the teacher menu or commands by downgrading prismarine.

**14w04a**
- Placing Snow on grass would not convert the grass to snowy grass

**14w25a**

**1.8.9**
- Currently there is a bug that allows for commands to be run in survival. This is known as Cross Word Commands, and it functions by first creating a creative world. From the creative world a redstone setup can be made to generate a large amount of lag at the same time it runs command blocks. The player then quickly logs out of the creative world and into the survival world, which has a chance to transfer the commands and have them run in survival. A creative world download will be added to "Mods & Extra Files"

**15w31a**
- When the dragon is resummoned, it generates a new end portal at 0 0, which can exist alongside the previous portal from earlier versions, thus allowing multiple end portals in the world.
- By removing nbt data from a spawn egg, either through brewing stand item transmutation or by shift clicking a spawn egg into an enchantment table, a no nbt spawn egg can be created. By using a spawn egg with no nbt on a spawner, a spawner missing nbt data can be created
- When building a creeper face, a 6x6 block of clay is removed. This however removes all blocks in this 6x6 area, including bedrock. This is a form of bedrock removal.

**18w09a**
- Furnaces now store recipes. Smelting Coal Ore, Diamond Ore, Emerald Ore, Gold Ore, Iron Ore, Lapis Lazuli Ore, Redstone Ore, or Chorus Fruit add recipe values that will be changed in future versions. These stored recipes are completely unobservable, and will be removed if an item is ever taken out of the furnace output slot manually, however hoppers can be used to remove items from the output slot and stack multiple recipes.

**18w10b**
- Currently updating the default shulker boxes from earlier versions converts them into purple shulker boxes, allowing for things such as overstacked purple shulker boxes

**18w47a**
- Currently chests that generate in ocean ruins have the block data of structure blocks, which is normally unobtainable. These chests cannot be opened, however they can visually connect to create a double chest. The structure block data, while unobservable, has the signature of ladyagnes.

**18w48a**
- Currently chests that generate inside a blacksmith have an incorrect loot table. This loot table will be unobtainable in future versions.

**18w50a**
- By update suppressing a container and then placing items within that container, a technique known as item shadowing can be performed, which allows for duplicate item references. Along with item duplication, this allows for the same item to be placed inside an enchantment table at the same time, allowing for duplicate enchantments on any item that can be placed in an enchanting table. Note this is not the first version this is obtainable, however it is the last.
- By placing containers in this version and then leaving them unloaded until 24w39a, the containers will become locked. Locked containers are normally unobtainable.

This occurs for any furnace recipe, not just those that work within a blast furnace/smoker, allowing for a variety of invalid items in the output slots of these two blocks.
- Downgrading a blast furnace or a smoker and using a hopper to input items for valid furnace recipes will add the furnace recipes under recipes used. Every single furnace recipe tag is discontinued on a smoker and blast furnace, allowing for a large assortment of discontinued blocks.This stored recipe is completely unobservable, and will be removed if an item is ever taken out of the  output slot manually, however hoppers can be used to remove items from the output slot and stack multiple recipes.

**1.19-Exp 1**
> [!Note]]
> In order to play your world in this version, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Reinforced Deepslate can currently be pushed by pistons, allowing for reinforced deepslate in any position in the overworld and allowing it be stored in block 36 form, both of which will be discontinued when the block is recontinued.

**22w13oneBlockAtATime**

- Spawner minecarts will now be one of two varieties depending on the update path taken. For an empty spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in 13w06a through 15w31d, then kept unloaded until 1.11, then kept unloaded again until this version. For a pig spawner minecart, the spawner minecart can be loaded in one of the versions of 1.13 or later. This snapshot technically creates a discontinued feature as a result of this split of spawner minecarts.

**22w46a**
- Added new noteblock instruments in the form of mob sounds. By placing a mob head on a noteblock, the note block will now play the corresponding sound of the mob. This introduces discontinued noteblocks, as any noteblocks with mob heads on them from earlier versions will have the incorrect instrument.

**1.19.3-Prerelease 1**

> In order to play your world in this version with update 1.21 experimental features enabled, world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Bundle datapack. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Crafters will currently output stacked written books into chiseled bookshelves when copying written books and stacked glass bottles into brewing stands when crafting glass bottles. These slots normally do not allow stacked items, making this a discontinued block configuration.

**23w45a**
- Trial spawners that generate in this version do not have ominous config data, meaning that they will not properly work as ominous spawners in future versions. These are future discontinued trial spawner variants.

**24w07a**
- The trial spawners that used to spawn skeletons holding poison arrows now spawn bogged, discontinuing the older variant of trial spawners. These trial spawners for bogged will have their simultaneous mobs added and loot distribution changed in future versions, making these a new discontinued variant of trial spawner themselves.

**24w09a**
- Currently any chunks with overstacked items can be savestated, as attempting to save invalid item counts of items (or bundles with invalid items inside of them) causes the chunk to revert to it's last save. This allows for item and block duplication, and many discontinued block configurations.

- Ruined portatols generate naturally in the overworld, and the chests that generate here have an invalid loot table of minecraft:chest/ruined_portatol
- Using any of the new smelting recipes in a furnace or smoker will store the recipes in the block data of the furnace/smoker. These are completely unobservable, and will be deleted if an item is ever taken out of the output slot manually. All these recipes will be removed in future versions, and these recipes can be stacked on top of other recipes utilizing hoppers to transfer items.
- Unobtainable and immovable blocks such as bedrock, end portal frames, reinforced deepslate, and budding amethyst can be pushed by the floatater, allowing for blocks in invalid positions. Additionally, floating support blocks can be created by attaching blocks to a floatater and powering it. Note this does not work with block entities.

This same process can be repeated to reenable the Villager Trade Rebalance datapack.
- Using a spawn egg on an ominous spawner causes the resulting mob to spawn with armor, even if this mob could not normally wear armor. This allows essentially all mobs wearing armor, and thus many discontinued mobs This additionally allows for all mobs to become dual wielding through using a spawn egg on trial spawners that spawn skeletons holding poisonous arrows.

**24w13a - 24w11a (Downgrading)**
- Downgrading trial spawners causes all tags except for the spawn potentials tag to be removed, resulting in these spawners lacking several tags. These are discontinued trial spawner variants.
