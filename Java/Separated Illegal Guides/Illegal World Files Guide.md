**Beta 1.3.2 - Infdev 20100624**
> [!Note]
> In order to access this version, the world save folder will have to be named as World[1-5]. During this downgrade, the level.dat and level.dat_old should be removed temporarily. A world without a level.dat can be accessed by selecting the respective slot when going to the singleplayer screen. The level.dat and level.dat_old will have to be restored when updating back to b1.3-2 in order to preserve the Alpha File Format folders of the next version. No chunks, entities, or placed blocks will be affected during this downgrade.	
- This version has a file format that is not used in any other version. A folder named "data" is used, and contains "entities.dat" and "zones.dat" This folder will become completely unused upon updating out of this version and nothing will be converted to a different file format. This creates several file discontinued features. 

**Beta 1.2_02-launcher**
- This is the last version that uses the Alpha file format. Since the Alpha File Format from the original world has already been converted, updating to this version will regenerate an entirely new world with the Alpha File Format. This allows for numerous folders in both the world save folder and the DIM-1 folder, that are titled with numbers and letters, which contain subfolders titled with numbers and letters, that contain .dat files, since this is how the Alpha File Format worked. There are hundreds of discontinued folders possible.
