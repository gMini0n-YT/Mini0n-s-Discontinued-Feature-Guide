**Beta 1.3.2 - Infdev 20100624**
> [!Note]
> In order to access this version, the world save folder will have to be named as World[1-5]. During this downgrade, the level.dat and level.dat_old should be removed temporarily. A world without a level.dat can be accessed by selecting the respective slot when going to the singleplayer screen. The level.dat and level.dat_old will have to be restored when updating back to b1.3-2 in order to preserve the Alpha File Format folders of the next version. No chunks, entities, or placed blocks will be affected during this downgrade.	
- This version has a file format that is not used in any other version. A folder named "data" is used, and contains "entities.dat" and "zones.dat" This folder will become completely unused upon updating out of this version and nothing will be converted to a different file format. This creates several file discontinued features.â€Š
