- The Farlands would generate except they are extremely far out, they are a flat wall and they are unreachable by normal means
- Brick Pyramids would spawn throughout the world, making it the only method of obtaining bricks, download the file in the "Mods & Extra Files" folder to help you find brick pyramids

- Monoliths would generate in flat terrain and they would spawn without bedrock underneath allowing for illegal terrain generation. You can use the Monolith Finder in the "Links" folder

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3-1**
> [!Note]
> Certain multiplayer exclusive chunks can be obtained, however it requires file manipulation. Regions from a newly generated multiplayer world can be copied into the pre-existing world. This would work by taking a region file, changing the numbers to not conflict with previously existing region files, and adding them to the preexisting world.
- Currently "Sky Dimension" chunks generate in a new multiplayer world. These are large floating islands that generate in the overworld, with large sections of void and no bedrock. There is no way to obtain these chunks in a pre-existing world, however the region files can be moved from a newly generated multiplayer world to the preexisting world by renumbering the newly generated region files

**Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6**
- The exit portal would generate when the ender dragon is killed but the exit portal would generate where the dragon died and not at 0,0 allowing for the exit end portal in discontinued locations

**12w07a**
- The End in this version does not generate with any main end island it is just you and the void. Additionally when you kill the ender dragon the exit portal will spawn where the dragon died instead of at 0.0
