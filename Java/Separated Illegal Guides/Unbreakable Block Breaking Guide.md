**Indev 20100206-2**
- Tilling Dirt underneath a block and then placing seeds on the farmland will remove the block above making it possible for bedrock removal

**Infdev 20100625-2**
- Placing Doors one block under a block will cause the upper half to break the block up above it making it possible for bedrock removal

**Alpha 1.2.6**
- Lava Lakes are able to cut through bedrock if spawned at the bottom of the world

**Beta 1.8 Prerelease 1-1**
- Placing a mushroom on any block and then bonemealing them would grow a big mushroom and replace the block underneath it with dirt making it possible for unbreakable bock removal

**11w49a**
- Pressing B changes the clientside gamemode to creative. This allows for Bedrock, Sponge, Chainmail Armor, Ice, and Creeper, Skeleton, Spider, Zombie, Slime, Ghast, Pig Zombie, Enderman, Cave Spider, Silverfish, Blaze, Magma Cube, Pig, Sheep, Cow, Chicken, Squid, Wolf, Mooshroom, and Villager Spawn Eggs. This also allows for easy bedrock removal.

**12w08a**
- Spawning an Iron Golem would remove the block above it meaning you can uses this as bedrock removal

**0.982 Classroom (EDU)**
- There is a teacher menu that allows for the teacher to enter creative mode and also gives numerous discontinued items.
- Currently any command can be run by joining the game as a teacher all while being in survival mode.
- A feature called the fill tool is toggleable. This allows for two locations to be selected and then filled with blocks. This allows for various discontinued block configurations, including multiple chests and floating buttons.

**12w37a**
- Wither can explode end portal frames when spawned which results in end portal frame removal.

**1.7.10 Build 20 Classroom-1 (EDU)**
- Command computers can be used to run any command in the game. This is different to the teachers menu in that this can be acheived by a non op player by using the command computer datapack linked in "Mods & Extra Files". It can also be obtained in survival without using the teacher menu or commands by downgrading prismarine.

**1.8.9**
- Currently there is a bug that allows for commands to be run in survival. This is known as Cross Word Commands, and it functions by first creating a creative world. From the creative world a redstone setup can be made to generate a large amount of lag at the same time it runs command blocks. The player then quickly logs out of the creative world and into the survival world, which has a chance to transfer the commands and have them run in survival. A creative world download will be added to "Mods & Extra Files"

**15w31a**
- Building a creeper face out of clay resummons the dragon. This allows for more than one dragon at a time, which is a discontinued amount of ender dragons.
- When building a creeper face, a 6x6 block of clay is removed. This however removes all blocks in this 6x6 area, including bedrock. This is a form of bedrock removal.

**15w44a**
- By placing an end crystal in the center of the exit end portal when attempting to resummon the ender dragon, there is a small chance bedrock will drop as an item, allowing it to be obtained.

**1.12.2**
- There is a complex method to obtain bedrock, possible by using silk touch at the exact moment an end gateway generates. This is not the first version this works in, but the last major version where this can occur.
- There is a complex method to obtain a barrier block in block form, possible by update suppressing an igloo at the exact moment a barrier block is used within generation. This is not the first version this works in, but the last major version where this can occur.

**21w05b (Datapack)**
> [!Note]
> This version requires the same Caves & Cliffs Datapack from the previous version, meaning no file editing is required if updating from the previous version
- The world height is now increased to 320, and extends below to -64. Any new chunks generated in this version with the datapack will have solid stone generate underneath all chunks extending down from Y0 to Y-64, with no bedrock.

**22w13oneBlockAtATime**
- The ender dragon can be brought into the overworld by flying it below Y-32 in the end
- Various items can be obtained in this version that are not normally obtainable. Budding Amethyst, Infested Deepslate Variants, Command Block Variants, Structure Blocks and Voids, Jigsaws, Spawners, Chorus Flowers, Light Blocks, Bedrock, Player Heads, Farmland, Petrified Oak Slabs, and End Portal Frames can all be obtained either through an enderman handing them to the player, and then storing them in a donkey or storing them as a falling entity, which is then dropped onto a torch in the following version. Storing them as an item will maintain the blockstate tag, whereas storing them as an entity will drop them without any nbt data. End portal frames also generate naturally in nether fortress loot table chests.
- Any block can be converted to a falling entity by using a dropper, or by throwing a block. These can be stored by dropping them onto block 36.  There are variations for every existing block and blockstate in the game.

**23w13a_or_b**
- Added a vote called the midas touch. This will convert every item in the player's inventory into golden equivalents, allowing for any nbt tag on golden ingots when paired with nbt crafting, as well as any normal nbt on various golden items. This also allows for negative durability on every piece of golden armor and tools.
- Utilizing movable block entities allows bedrock to be pushed and thus bedrock in invalid locations and bedrock removal
- The pickaxe block can be placed adjacent to unbreakable blocks and break those blocks, allowing for bedrock removal
- Added a vote rule that allows any block to be ignited with a flint and steel. This means unbreakable blocks like end portal frames and bedrock can be broken by igniting them with a flint and steel, thus this is a form of unbreakable block removal.

> [!Note]
> In order to play your world in this version world save insertion must be used. This requires first removing the world save from the world saves folder. From here, select create world and create a world with the same folder name as the world save. Then select the Datapacks or Experimental option and enable the Update 1.21, Villager Trade Rebalance, and the Bundle datapack. Then, while still in the create world screen, drag the world save into the saves folder, and select create world. This forces the world to load without removing the level.dat or level.dat_old files.
- Unobtainable and immovable blocks such as bedrock, end portal frames, reinforced deepslate, and budding amethyst can be pushed by the floatater, allowing for blocks in invalid positions. Additionally, floating support blocks can be created by attaching blocks to a floatater and powering it. Note this does not work with block entities.
