**Indev to Infdev Conversion Tutorial**

1. Put all of your inventory contents into a container before doing this process
2. Download MCEdit Testing 288 from the "Mods & Extra Files" folder.
3. Save your world that you want to convert as a .mclevel file 
4. Create a world in any Infdev Version, the earliest being Infdev 20100316 and save the world
5. Open the world in MCEdit, and press ctrl + a and click "Chunk Control" (the icon furthest to the right in the hotbar) and click delete all chunks
6. Then click on the crane icon in slot 6 of the hotbar and import the mclevel you saved. If it does not import correctly you can rename the world to include the size of the world (e.g. level_256_256_64), remember the dimensions go as width, length, height
7. Then press Chunk Align and press import
8. If you want you can also move your world spawn location to an ideal spot. (Steve in a spawner icon)
