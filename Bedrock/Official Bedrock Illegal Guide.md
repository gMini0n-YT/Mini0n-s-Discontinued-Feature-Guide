**(0.12.1 Downgrade**): Downgrading client to 0.12.1 and renaming world you would like to downgrade will cause the world to downgrade to 0.12 without any corruption. This allows to easily downgrade to any version above 0.12.1. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- In this version, Item duplication is possible and items can be stacked past their usual limits. To do this follow these steps, open your world to LAN and connect on a second device/instance. Throw the items that you would like to duplicate or overstack to the second device. After 10 seconds of the items being picked up relog on the 1st/host device and when returning the items on the second device should have overstacked. Place these items in the chest to keep their overstacked state. The overstacked items will usually exceed 99 and show up as 99+, sometimes the items will have a negative item count and still show up as 99+
- Cacti can grow adjacent to blocks
- Placing Torches on the side of a block and placing a painting on the same block will overlap the painting and the torches

- In this version, Logs can now be placed sideways. Mining up the sideways Logs will give you Invalid Data Value Logs

The /give command can give you many different illegals in this version using the following syntax "/give {player} {id} {count} {data}", the following illegals from this glitch are as followed: Grass Block (2): (/give Steve 2 64), Bedrock (7), Flowing Water (8), Stationary Water (9), Flowing Lava (10), Stationary Lava (11), Bed (Block Item) (26), Shrub (31), Smooth Stone Double Slab (43), Sandstone Double Slab (43:1): {/give Steve 43 64 1}, Petrified Oak Double Slab (43:2): {/give Steve 43 64 2}, Cobblestone Double Slab (43:3), Brick Double Slab (43:4), Stone Brick Double Slab (43:5), Quartz Double Slab (43:6), Petrified Oak Slab (44:2), Fire (51), Crop (Wheat) (59), Farmland (60), Lit Furnace (62), Oak Standing Sign (63), Oak Door (Block Item) (64), Oak Wall Sign (68), Iron Door (Block Item) (71), Lit Redstone Ore (74), Sugar Cane (Block Item) (83), Cake (Block Item) (92), Invisible Bedrock (95), Smooth Stone Brick (98:4), Pumpkin Stem (104), Melon Stem (105), Fake Cake (Block Item) (126), Carrot Crop (141), Potato Crop (142), Oak Double Slab (157), Spruce Double Slab (157:1), Birch Double Slab (157:2), Jungle Double Slab (157:3), Glowing Obsidian (246), Info Update (248), Info Update2 (249), Reserved6 (255), Chicken Spawn Egg (383:10), Cow Spawn Egg (383:11), Pig Spawn Egg (383:12), Sheep Spawn Egg (383:13), Zombie Spawn Egg (383:32), Creeper Spawn Egg (383:33), Skeleton Spawn Egg (383:34), Spider Spawn Egg (383:35), Zombie Pigman Spawn Egg (383:36), Camera (456). You can also get other weird spawn eggs by updating to newer versions of the game if you get a spawn egg using this damage value (383:66), it will give you a falling block spawn egg in later versions of the game, if you get a double slab with damage value of 7 (43:7), it will update to a Nether Brick Double Slab in later versions. Finally, using this glitch you can also get a "Player Spawn Egg", to get it in current versions you can use the damage value of 63 (383:63), but it won't spawn a player. To get a spawn egg that spawns a player in later versions you must use the following damage value for the corresponding versions: Beta 1.8.0.8: (383:258), Beta 1.11.0.3: (383:259), Beta 1.13.0.1: (383:258), Beta 1.14.0.1: (383:257). Going to these versions will spawn the player entity. 

**0.9.0 alpha (Android)**

**0.9.0-b2 alpha (Android)**
- Spawners currently have a max spawn delay of 200 ticks. In future versions, all spawners will have this value set at 800 ticks, making these discontinued spawners. 

**0.11.0 alpha (Android)**
- Reloading the world while a block is falling causes the block to convert to a falling air block, which when lands drops an air item entity. Air item entities are temporarily discontinued, as they do get deleted in future versions but I thought it was worth mentioning

**0.11.1 - Present**
- Upgrading the Player and all mobs from 0.11.1 to the version range of 1.19.60.25 to Present will cause the base value of the player's minecraft:movement attribute is set to 0.7 (7x higher than normal).

- Colors in this version have a different color value than colors in the newer version, the following colors are: white, brown, lime, green, cyan, light blue, blue, purple, magenta and pink, meaning that there can be thousand of illegal color variants by combining them in a cauldron. This also gives us two extra illegals: Cauldrons with illegal color value and Leather Armor with illegal color value
  
**0.15.2.1 alpha (Android)**
- Doors have a durability of 66 in this version and keep their damage value upon updating. Stacking Normal Doors with Durability Doors will remove the durability of the door.

- Downgrading from **0.15.0** to **0.12.1** alpha will transform these enchants which will transform back when updating: Fortune -> Power, Silk Touch -> Unbreaking, Infinity - Luck of the Sea. So putting Unbreaking on any item in **0.12.1** and then updating back to **0.15.0** will give you Silk Touch on any item. Putting Luck of the Sea on a Fishing Rod in **0.12.1** and updating to **0.15.0** will give you an Infinity Fishing Rod. Putting Power IV/V on a Book or Bow will give you a Fortune IV/V Book or Bow. Finally combining Power 1-5 and Unbreaking can give you a Silk Touch and Fortune enchantment on the same book.

To do this you must select one of the red crafting recipe from the recipe book. Then select the item that you would like to duplicate that has a red background to it (make sure you do not have a second item that you would like to duplicate in your inventory) and move it to another spot in the crafting recipe. You should then have access to the item that you moved and be able to use it in other crafting recipes. Using this glitch you can obtain Lingering Decay Potions from the Decay Arrow Recipe.
- Using this craftin glitch you can obtain negative durability shovels from the boat recipe and negative durability bows from the dispenser recipe. After obtaining these you must combine the negative durability item with a normal low durability item so that when updating the negative durability item does not change to a normal item.

**1.2.10**
- Using the Nested Shulker Box trick from 1.2.0.2 you can get a whole lot more illegals from a glitch called CSC (Compressed Shulker Conversion).

- Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing use the same ids as Loyalty and Channeling respectively, so in future versions all the Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing will turn into Loyalty and Channeling. This allows for Loyalty on every armor piece, and Channeling for every armor and tool that can have Curse of Vanishing on it.
- Impaling and Riptide use the same id as Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing respectively, so in future versions all the Impaling and Riptide books will turn into Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing. This allows for Curse of Binding 2-5 and Curse of Vanishing 2-3 books and villager trades.
- Helmets can be enchanted with any enchant in the game this allows for a Helmet with sword enchants or any other enchants in the game.

<br>
- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy.

You can obtain any item from the CSC glitch with the IDs of -33 to -63 and 33 to 63. A giving an id of -33 and B giving and id of 33. This is a list of Elements and illegals with the letter/symbol that you can obtain them with in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1kHdwFMY0aLSELdt6vEQ3p2LySG4ivMbEJv6oP-MihZI/edit?gid=0&pli=1&authuser=0#gid=0
- In 1.5, Zombie Villagers found in Zombie Villages will be extremely fast. Updating from 1.5 directly to 1.21.41 will revert them. To keep them you must update from 1.5 to 1.8 to 1.10 to 1.11 to 1.21 in that order.
- Invalid oak buttons could be obtained in survival mode by mining an oak button with an enchanted Silk Touch tool.

List of Illegals are in the "1.16.1.2 Guide" file in the "Links Folder". Using this glitch may be considered cheating but it relies on personal preference, some commands will be for sure considered cheating.

**1.16.40 - 0.6.0**
> [!Note]
> If your phone is crashing upon creating a world in 0.6.0, you can unzip the "Cross Dimension Chunk Template" zip file and move the extracted folder to "games > com.mojang > minecraftWorlds" Note: this may be considered cheating because it does require you to move world files
- You can get Cross Dimension Chunks (e.g. Overworld Chunks in the end/nether) by entering the end at these specific coordinates 115, 100, 149 in 1.16.40. Downgrade your client to 0.6.0 and create a world in 0.6.0 with the same seed as your 1.16.40 save. After loading the world, disconnect from the world and move the db folder of the 1.16.40 world to the 0.6.0 save. Once done upgrade back to 1.16.40 and change the world to infinite, it may crash but just reload minecraft and just try again.

- It is possible to obtain villagers with incorrect trades, such as a fletcher with stone mason trades. To achieve this, follow these steps: First, place 20 beds, with 19 of them corresponding to one type of workstation and 1 bed with a different type of workstation. Next, bring 20 villagers to the area where you have set up the beds and workstations. Then you have to zombify all the villagers (for a 100% zombification rate, ensure you are in hard mode). Once they are zombified, you can cure them. If done correctly, one of the villagers should have incorrect trades. This occurs because the villager retains their profession after being zombified, but during the curing process, there is a brief moment when they can change professions before returning to their original state. Please note that this method does not guarantee a 100% success rate

**1.18.10.26 - 1.18.10.22**

The side of the main end island does matter on what you'll get in the regeneration, on one side all it will do is regenerate the block without changing the data of the block at all (this is called VCR (Valid Chunk Regen)). On the other side of the main end island will regenerate the blocks but either make them invisible or unfunctionable (this is called ICR (Invalid Chunk Regen)). To tell which chunk is which type type of Regen (VCR or ICR) StormofLight and VirsRJ made a chart of chunks showing which chunks are ICR or VCR, it will be titled "ChunkRegenerationGraph.webp" in "Links". This glitch can be used to create unique blocks like half-beds, invisible shulker boxes, and headless pistons using ICR. This also allows for the creation of different types of wall skulls based on the placement and orientation of the skulls. Placing a skull on the ground gives a Wither Skeleton Wall Skull, while placing them against a wall in certain cardinal directions results in various skulls: West yields a Creeper Wall Skull, South a Steve Wall Skull, North a Zombie Wall Skull, and East a Dragon Wall Skull using ICR. You can also get tons of illegals from ICR by placing tile entities listed in this Minecraft Wiki page https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_entity.
