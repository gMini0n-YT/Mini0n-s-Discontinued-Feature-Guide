On the other side of the main end island will regenerate the blocks but either make them invisible or unfunctionable (this is called ICR (Invalid Chunk Regen)). To tell which chunk is which type type of Regen (VCR or ICR) StormofLight and VirsRJ made a chart of chunks showing which chunks are ICR or VCR, it will be titled "ChunkRegenerationGraph.webp" in "Links". This glitch can be used to create unique blocks like half-beds, invisible shulker boxes, and headless pistons using ICR. This also allows for the creation of different types of wall skulls based on the placement and orientation of the skulls. Placing a skull on the ground gives a Wither Skeleton Wall Skull, while placing them against a wall in certain cardinal directions results in various skulls: West yields a Creeper Wall Skull, South a Steve Wall Skull, North a Zombie Wall Skull, and East a Dragon Wall Skull using ICR. You can also get tons of illegals from ICR by placing tile entities listed in this Minecraft Wiki page https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_entity. You can also get tons of VCR listed in the "Valid Chunk Regeneration Illegals.txt" in the "Links" folder. Tutorial: https://youtu.be/IPCpwxhccsg?si=HzK8bc5HLcrKgLDP
