***KEY WORDS***

**(Android)**: Android Exclusive Version
<br>
**(UBC)**: The process of downgrading a block to another version converting it to an Unknown Block, mining it up, and then upgrading to 1.21.30 to obtain the block
<br>
**(Experimental)**: Turning on the Experimental Toggle
<br>
**(X.XX.XX.X - Y.YY.YY.Y)**: Version Upgrading or Downgrading from and to 
<br>
**(0.12.1 Downgrade**): Downgrading client to 0.12.1 and renaming world you would like to downgrade will cause the world to downgrade to 0.12 without any corruption. This allows to easily downgrade to any version above 0.12.1. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**0.3.2 alpha (Android)**
- World names can be up to 1023 characters long. The first 255 characters can be any letter/symbol on the normal keyboard. The final characters can only be characters that are not allowed on android such as /, , :, *, ?, ", <, >, and |.
- Line breaks are allowed in world names

**0.11.1 - Present**
- Upgrading the Player and all mobs from 0.11.1 to the version range of 1.19.60.25 to Present will cause the base value of the player's minecraft:movement attribute is set to 0.7 (7x higher than normal). This results in the player permanently being 7x faster when walking, sneaking, or sprinting. **WARNING**: Do not downgrade when at the version or it will reset the attribute removing the speed also you cannot go to other versions before upgrading to 1.19.60.25 or you will also lose the attribute

**0.17.0.1 alpha (Android)**
> [!CAUTION]
> PDV: Hitting a Mob or getting hit by a mob will crash the game.

- Updating a world from **0.15.9** alpha to this version will overwrite biome data of chunks causing the biomes to change into a stripe pattern. This can cause Overworld mobs to spawn in the Nether.

**1.2.13.8 - 1.2.6.60**
> [!CAUTION]
> Block Pallet Corruption (BPC)is possible using downgrading from this version range but this could make your world unplayable, if you don't have a strong device. If you are stuck in the loading screen just force close minecraft and try again. Make sure to make backups
<br>
- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy. These chunks have a random block pallet and can create a lot of illegal formations, like nether wart on top of brewing stand, or illegal blocks such as Education Edition Blocks, and Creative placed Blocks

**1.16.0.51 (Beta)**
- In development and debug versions of the game, it was possible to enable a setting within the debug options to create a flat Nether world.

**1.16.40 - 0.6.0**
> [!Note]
> If your phone is crashing upon creating a world in 0.6.0, you can unzip the "Cross Dimension Chunk Template" zip file and move the extracted folder to "games > com.mojang > minecraftWorlds" Note: this may be considered cheating because it does require you to move world files
- You can get Cross Dimension Chunks (e.g. Overworld Chunks in the end/nether) by entering the end at these specific coordinates 115, 100, 149 in 1.16.40. Downgrade your client to 0.6.0 and create a world in 0.6.0 with the same seed as your 1.16.40 save. After loading the world, disconnect from the world and move the db folder of the 1.16.40 world to the 0.6.0 save. Once done upgrade back to 1.16.40 and change the world to infinite, it may crash but just reload minecraft and just try again.

**1.16.100**
- Placing an end gateway on the central pillar of the end fountain when the dragon perches, it will freeze the dragon. After relogging an end gateway will appear where the ender dragon was. This allows for over 20 end gateways in the main end island.

**Beta 1.17.0.52 (Experimental)**
- Chunks loaded with the Caves & Cliffs Experiment Toggle and updating it to the official version 1.17.0 will cause the chunks loaded to be elevated when updating. All tile entity data will be removed allowing for mobless mob spawners

**1.17.10**
- Previously loaded chunks will get 64 bedrock layers if you turn on the "Caves and Cliff" experimental toggle

**Beta 1.18.0.24**
- Deep Warm Oceans can still naturally generate. To make deep warm oceans distinguishable, you can use the Discontinued Feature Tweaks texture pack in the "Texture Packs" folder

**1.18.0**
- Updating any world to this version will not generate anything below y=0 if there is no bedrock at y=0
- - Aquifers can generate with missing pieces of water
- Spikes out of Dripstone Block can spawn on the surface
- Structures like Ocean Ruins often spawn on land
- Some igloos can generate with Redstone Torches facing the wrong way.
- Mountain generation breaks at 2.812.332 blocks away from 0, 0 and replaces everything within a Frozen Peaks or Stony Peaks biome, except Aquifers, with huge lava ravines. These Aquifers can stretch all the way down to lava height and be on top of the lava without updating it and turning it into Obsidian. An example can be found on the Seed: -1485667881, at 2891297 -49 9439. On certain iOS devices, Monolith-like terrain generates instead of Lava Ravines. These "Monoliths" can go up to the old world height limit, y=256

**Beta 1.18.30.28**
- Older worlds that have areas unexplored since before 1.18 will have corrupted chunks below y=0

**Beta 1.18.30.32**
- Aquifers can sometimes intersect with Ancient City structures and submerge/destroy big chunks of the structure
