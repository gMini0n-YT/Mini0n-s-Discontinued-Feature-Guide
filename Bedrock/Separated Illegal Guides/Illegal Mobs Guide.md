Placing a Nether Portal at the world spawn exactly will send the Ender Dragon to the Nether once it is transferred out of the End

**1.7.0**
- You can put a Jack-o-lantern on an armor stand, player, and mobs via dispensers

**1.10.0 (Experimental)**

- Farmer Villagers buy 16 eggs at the Expert Trade Level

**1.16.1.2**
- You can exploit commands in this version by removing the space between the /give and the @ symbol. This will not turn off achievements allowing for commands in a vanilla world. This can give you infinite amount of illegals including bedrock, spawn eggs, top slabs, command blocks, and weird blocks in the furnace fuel slot. List of Illegals are in the "1.16.1.2 Guide" file in the "Links Folder". Using this glitch may be considered cheating but it relies on personal preference, some commands will be for sure considered cheating. 
- Giving yourself an item that has a durability bar and adding the metadata of 9999 will give you negative durability items. So using the /give@s netherite_sword 1 9999 will give you a negative durability netherite sword. Combining 4 of these negative durability items in a crafting recipe will give you an unbreakable item with almost infinite durability.
- Using the /execute command you can obtain a lot of other commands by using /execute@s ~ ~ ~ and then your command. Using this method with the /replaceitem command can give you many different items in the furnace output slot and many different items in mobs offhand.

- Punching an End Crystal while summoning the Ender Dragon, and standing in the exit portal will send you back to the overworld.

You sometimes may get 3 end crystals at your exit portal depending on the speed you go back to the Overworld.

- It is possible to obtain villagers with incorrect trades, such as a fletcher with stone mason trades. To achieve this, follow these steps: First, place 20 beds, with 19 of them corresponding to one type of workstation and 1 bed with a different type of workstation. Next, bring 20 villagers to the area where you have set up the beds and workstations. Then you have to zombify all the villagers (for a 100% zombification rate, ensure you are in hard mode). Once they are zombified, you can cure them. If done correctly, one of the villagers should have incorrect trades. This occurs because the villager retains their profession after being zombified, but during the curing process, there is a brief moment when they can change professions before returning to their original state. Please note that this method does not guarantee a 100% success rate
