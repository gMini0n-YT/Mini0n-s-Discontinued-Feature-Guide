1) Empty out a subchunk at the bottom of the world (requires the breaking of bedrock),
2) Leave placeholder block in the subchunk to prevent it from reverting to the previous save,
3) Build an update suppressor in the the same chunk but not the same subchunk (ideally above the empty chunk for regen),
   - Method for update suppression could vary but the most reliable design can be found in this video:

4) Prebuild any illegal block formation you want,
   - For example: Place sea pickles onto a valid block such as dirt.
   NOTE: Do not use any blocks that could trigger a random update after the regen!
5) Activate the update suppressor,
   WARNING: Leaving this machine for long periods of time can risk world corruption (make backup world saves)!
6) Wait for around 10 seconds for the update suppressor to create enough useless pending ticks,
7) Modify the prebuild into whatever illegal block formation you want,
   - For example: Replace the dirt under the sea pickles with glowstone,
8) Quickly save and exit the game,
   NOTE: If the blocks update before you relog you will have to restart,
9) Join the world and empty the subchunk with the illegal formations inside,
10) Deactivate the update suppressor,
    NOTE: For survival players, I advise using bubble columns outside of the two chunks for fast movement between them,
11) Quickly save and exit the game again,
12) Join the world and empty the subchunk with the illegal formations,
13) Move to the chunk that contains the update suppressor,
14) Place a support needing block (like a torch) against another block in the subchunk and then break the block giving it support.
    If the support needing block breaks instantly then you can stop waiting and then save and exit :D
     - The longer you leave the machine active, the longer you have to spend waiting :<
13) Enjoy your awesome block formations! :D


Examples of some possible illegal block formations:
 - Floating ladders,
 - Sea pickles on glowstone/sea lanterns,
 - Waterless sea grass/kelp/double sea grass,
 - Torches supported by fences,
 - Floating/Reversed bubble columns,
 - Basically anything that doesn't have random ticks and is affected by the update suppression!
