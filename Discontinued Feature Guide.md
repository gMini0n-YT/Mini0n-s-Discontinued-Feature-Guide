- Invalid oak buttons could be obtained in survival mode by mining an oak button with an enchanted Silk Touch tool. Note that the direction the player was facing determined the damage/metadata value the oak button had upon dropping as an item.

List of Illegals are in the "1.16.1.2 Guide" file in the "Links Folder". Using this glitch may be considered cheating but it relies on personal preference, some commands will be for sure considered cheating.

After loading the world, disconnect from the world and move the db folder of the 1.16.40 world to the 0.6.0 save. Once done upgrade back to 1.16.40 and change the world to infinite, it may crash but just reload minecraft and just try again.

**Beta 1.16.100.56**
- Inside Woodland Mansions, it is possible to obtain an Egg enchanted with Efficiency 1. These eggs can be located in a secret room containing a chest and a tree. This room is easily identifiable due to its blocked-off entrance, though the frame remains visible.

To find the Glow Sticks you must find the "secret" end portal room within the Woodland Mansion. The room is a lot harder to find because it has no indicator to locate it. To make things easier for you, go ahead and download the "Mansion X-Ray.mcpack" from the "Texture Pack" folder. This pack will x-ray through the dark-oak planks in the woodland mansion.

**Beta 1.18.0.24**
- Deep Warm Oceans can still naturally generate. To make deep warm oceans distinguishable, you can use the Discontinued Feature Tweaks texture pack in the "Texture Packs" folder

**1.18.0**
- Updating any world to this version will not generate anything below y=0 if there is no bedrock at y=0
- Placing walls under floating candles will cause the walls to fully stretch
- Pushing piglins through a nether portal while they are trying to barter with the player will force them to put the item that was given to them into their offhand, making them dual wielding mobs

These Aquifers can stretch all the way down to lava height and be on top of the lava without updating it and turning it into Obsidian. An example can be found on the Seed: -1485667881, at 2891297 -49 9439. On certain iOS devices, Monolith-like terrain generates instead of Lava Ravines. These "Monoliths" can go up to the old world height limit, y=256

**Beta 1.18.10.24 (Experimental)**
- Glow Lichen can be placed on Frog Eggs

**1.18.10**
- It is possible to obtain villagers with incorrect trades, such as a fletcher with stone mason trades. To achieve this, follow these steps: First, place 20 beds, with 19 of them corresponding to one type of workstation and 1 bed with a different type of workstation. Next, bring 20 villagers to the area where you have set up the beds and workstations. Then you have to zombify all the villagers (for a 100% zombification rate, ensure you are in hard mode). Once they are zombified, you can cure them. If done correctly, one of the villagers should have incorrect trades. This occurs because the villager retains their profession after being zombified, but during the curing process, there is a brief moment when they can change professions before returning to their original state. Please note that this method does not guarantee a 100% success rate

**1.18.10.26 - 1.18.10.22**
- Downgrading a cartographer with the globe pattern trade from 1.18.10.26 to 1.18.10.22 turns the trade into an empty trade

Globe banners will keep the globe banner tag, which means they will revert to normal banners when upgrading back. To avoid this, simply place the banners down and break them. This will remove the globe banner tag and preserve the "item.banner.base.x" tag

**1.18.12**
- Gravity Blocks will not fall if placed directly above top snow
- Red & Brown Mushroom Blocks, Chorus Plants & Flowers, Iron & Gold Nuggets and Nether Bricks can be placed into the fuel slot in Furnaces

Mine up the unknown block (making sure that they do not stack) and then updating to 1.21.30 will give you the tile.pistonarmcollision.name, tile.stickypistonarmcollision.name, tile.movingblock.name, and the Tripwire as a tile item.

**1.18.30.33 - 1.18.30.31 (Experimental) (UBC)**

- All types of Torches, redstone dust, Glow Lichen and Walls can be placed or attached to Bells
- Placing blocks in the lowest subchunk of a dimension and then reloading the dimension to save it and mining up all the blocks placed in the subchunk and reloading the dimension will regenerate the blocks mined up. The side of the main end island does matter on what you'll get in the regeneration, on one side all it will do is regenerate the block without changing the data of the block at all (this is called VCR (Valid Chunk Regen)). On the other side of the main end island will regenerate the blocks but either make them invisible or unfunctionable (this is called ICR (Invalid Chunk Regen)). To tell which chunk is which type type of Regen (VCR or ICR) StormofLight and VirsRJ made a chart of chunks showing which chunks are ICR or VCR, it will be titled "ChunkRegenerationGraph.webp" in "Links". This glitch can be used to create unique blocks like half-beds, invisible shulker boxes, and headless pistons using ICR. This also allows for the creation of different types of wall skulls based on the placement and orientation of the skulls. Placing a skull on the ground gives a Wither Skeleton Wall Skull, while placing them against a wall in certain cardinal directions results in various skulls: West yields a Creeper Wall Skull, South a Steve Wall Skull, North a Zombie Wall Skull, and East a Dragon Wall Skull using ICR. You can also get tons of illegals from ICR by placing tile entities listed in this Minecraft Wiki page https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_entity. You can also get tons of VCR listed in the "Valid Chunk Regeneration Illegals.txt" in the "Links" folder. Tutorial: https://youtu.be/IPCpwxhccsg?si=HzK8bc5HLcrKgLDP
