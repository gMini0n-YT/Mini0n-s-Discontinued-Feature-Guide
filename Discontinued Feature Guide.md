<br>
- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy.

List of Illegals are in the "1.16.1.2 Guide" file in the "Links Folder". Using this glitch may be considered cheating but it relies on personal preference, some commands will be for sure considered cheating. 
- Giving yourself an item that has a durability bar and adding the metadata of 9999 will give you negative durability items. So using the /give@s netherite_sword 1 9999 will give you a negative durability netherite sword. Combining 4 of these negative durability items in a crafting recipe will give you an unbreakable item with almost infinite durability.
- Using the /execute command you can obtain a lot of other commands by using /execute@s ~ ~ ~ and then your command. Using this method with the /replaceitem command can give you many different items in the furnace output slot and many different items in mobs offhand.

Downgrade your client to 0.6.0 and create a world in 0.6.0 with the same seed as your 1.16.40 save. After loading the world, disconnect from the world and move the db folder of the 1.16.40 world to the 0.6.0 save. Once done upgrade back to 1.16.40 and change the world to infinite, it may crash but just reload minecraft and just try again.

**Beta 1.16.100.56**
- Inside Woodland Mansions, it is possible to obtain an Egg enchanted with Efficiency 1. These eggs can be located in a secret room containing a chest and a tree. This room is easily identifiable due to its blocked-off entrance, though the frame remains visible.

- When animals and villagers are bred, they use the current speed rather than the base speed. So by splashing two animals/villagers with splash potion of speed or slowness and then breeding them, the offspring will be faster/slower than their parents. This process can be repeated endlessly
- Breeding two foxes with netherite armor will cause their offspring to inherit the knockback resistance from their parents.

An example can be found on the Seed: -1485667881, at 2891297 -49 9439. On certain iOS devices, Monolith-like terrain generates instead of Lava Ravines.

**1.18.10**
- It is possible to obtain villagers with incorrect trades, such as a fletcher with stone mason trades. To achieve this, follow these steps: First, place 20 beds, with 19 of them corresponding to one type of workstation and 1 bed with a different type of workstation. Next, bring 20 villagers to the area where you have set up the beds and workstations. Then you have to zombify all the villagers (for a 100% zombification rate, ensure you are in hard mode). Once they are zombified, you can cure them. If done correctly, one of the villagers should have incorrect trades. This occurs because the villager retains their profession after being zombified, but during the curing process, there is a brief moment when they can change professions before returning to their original state. Please note that this method does not guarantee a 100% success rate

**1.18.10.26 - 1.18.10.22**

Mine up the unknown block (making sure that they do not stack) and then updating to 1.21.30 will give you the tile.pistonarmcollision.name, tile.stickypistonarmcollision.name, tile.movingblock.name, and the Tripwire as a tile item.

- Placing blocks in the lowest subchunk of a dimension and then reloading the dimension to save it and mining up all the blocks placed in the subchunk and reloading the dimension will regenerate the blocks mined up. The side of the main end island does matter on what you'll get in the regeneration, on one side all it will do is regenerate the block without changing the data of the block at all (this is called VCR (Valid Chunk Regen)). On the other side of the main end island will regenerate the blocks but either make them invisible or unfunctionable (this is called ICR (Invalid Chunk Regen)). To tell which chunk is which type type of Regen (VCR or ICR) StormofLight and VirsRJ made a chart of chunks showing which chunks are ICR or VCR, it will be titled "ChunkRegenerationGraph.webp" in "Links". This glitch can be used to create unique blocks like half-beds, invisible shulker boxes, and headless pistons using ICR. This also allows for the creation of different types of wall skulls based on the placement and orientation of the skulls. Placing a skull on the ground gives a Wither Skeleton Wall Skull, while placing them against a wall in certain cardinal directions results in various skulls: West yields a Creeper Wall Skull, South a Steve Wall Skull, North a Zombie Wall Skull, and East a Dragon Wall Skull using ICR. You can also get tons of illegals from ICR by placing tile entities listed in this Minecraft Wiki page https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_entity. You can also get tons of VCR listed in the "Valid Chunk Regeneration Illegals.txt" in the "Links" folder. Tutorial: https://youtu.be/IPCpwxhccsg?si=HzK8bc5HLcrKgLDP
